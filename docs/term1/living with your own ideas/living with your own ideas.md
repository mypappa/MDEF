- How will you live together?  
The wearable mask will be tied around and covering my face. It consists of a base made out of plastic soap bottle and an external layer of aluminium foil, which will be changing.   
It works as an extension of the face, a piece of clothing. It can adapt its surface according to the situation.  

- What does it notice?  
It notices my personal needs while interacting with people and transforms the material, the face expressions or any kind of message I want to give to my surroundings by transforming its outer layer.  

- What were you thinking?   
My wishful superpower has always been the ability to disappear and become temporarily invisible. To some extent it is related to my need for control over my appearance, my body, myself. Our face is like a screen which projects personal information even in unwanted situations. Even the characteristics of one's face, regardless of the expression can cause prejudiced and biased reactions. My aim was to somehow protect - address - test the above situations on a personal but also on a social level.  

- Why does it matter?  
The 'mask' is a very primitive yet contemporary object with a great history in multiple fields: We can see is as an object for performing arts, rituals, punishment, disguise, fashion, hygiene etc. This idea of mask attempts to become an integral part of the self in daily life which will open new communication channels with the surroundings and bring comfort in uncomfortable situations.    

After wearing the mask and moving around the city for a whole afternoon, I noticed the following **contradictions**:  
- comfort in hiding *vs* discomfort in breathing  
- liberating expression *vs* limiting communication  
- protection *vs* opportunity for exposure (similar effect to our digital ID)
- attention avoidance (eg random unwanted acquaintances) *vs* attention catcher (it looks quite creepy)
