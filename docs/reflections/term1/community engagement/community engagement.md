`track: reflection`  

The "community engagement" challenge sounded very stimulating at first. I was really looking forward to actively collaborate with an existing group of people with whom I share interests, until I started getting deeper into my personal research. Gradually it started getting too far from something realistic, something I could picture. The main reason for this is that I had a very narrow idea of what 'engaging a community' means so I developed some sort of a denial towards it.  

Only when I could break the boundaries of is a community, I could envision me practicing it.

For this narrative I am going to involve and get involved with communities of all kinds: physical or digital, human and non-human, homogeneous or heterogeneous, preexisting or spontaneous.
In a small scale, each human forms a whole interconnected community which in a larger scale performs as a unity within another kind of community.  
Random passengers on the street can also form a community, without being aware thereof. It's all a matter of perspective.

## nonference  
One of the ideas we are working on with my team stella is organising our own conference in Barcelona. It will take place both in a physical but also virtual space and the aim is to bring together **the community of our mind map**. In that way we will raise the questions that we have been exploring and hopefully create a dialogue with the diverse participants -who individually represent other communities.
