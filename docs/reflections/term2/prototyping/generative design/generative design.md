this challenge seemed like a nice opportunity to give another chance to my relationship with grasshopper. Coming from an architecture school, I have used it in a minimum amount but always thought I will somehow get back to it, with or without the role of the architect. And so it happened.  

I wanted to model something organic, but with a twist! so I found on youtube a tutorial of a tree-like shape, which reminded me of a tornado, a structural column, or a rose flower.  

The tutorial was quite advanced -for my level- but I really enjoyed re-discovering some of the endless possibilities of grasshopper! And the most fascinating part of parametric design is after its more or less done, where you can play with the sliders and transform the whole body of the design and fine tune everything with no order. you can jump from the first compoment the the last in an 'anarchic' way, without losing any of the interrelationships.  

so here is the result..
