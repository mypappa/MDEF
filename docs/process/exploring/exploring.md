Hermetic Spirituality and Altered states of Knowledge  
by Prof. dr. Wouter Hanegraaff | 20/10/2022  

- *"Techniques for altering consciousness leads to different states of knowledge"*  
- *"In order to regain the perfect cosmic consciousness you have to be reborn"*  
- *'Nous' doesn’t mean knowledge. It’s our spiritual capacity to experience the universe of light.*  
- *'Logos' is energy*
- *"Hermeticism, although it existed as a "mystic religious" movement, does not have as its foundation faith but in research. It advocates the knowledge of the Divine (God) as the supreme good, and in contrast, the "ignorance of the Divine" as the deepest misery of the soul."*

- spiders  
*"Spiders from different species have spun interconnecting webs in the same space, bridging the architecture of each other's webs and telling a story of hybrid relationships. The webs serve as an extension of the spiders' sensorial and cognitive systems where lines of communication merge and connect.(..)Engaging in those collaborative relationships and creative dynamics is a way of attuning to others' Umwelten - or 'self-centred' world - and moving towards novel ways of living together."*   

- interactive installation   
*"Consciousness extends outside the brain in the form of cultural prostheses, such as writing, art, music and other symbolic structures"*  

- collective intelligence  
*"Ant and termite colonies have been dubbed 'superorganisms. These societies grow and develop, have memory and learning, an extended mind (their nests) and affect ecosystems across continents."*  

- déjà-Vu  
*"An algorithm determines the patterns that are repeated more frequently in the collection..the most interesting thing about this generative process is the errors made by the system itself: the random trials, the failed tests, the unforeseeable rejects, in short, the technological subconscious that emerges through the accidents. A machine- fabricated imaginary generates strange, sometimes dreamlike, often surreal results: creations our imagination could not anticipate and which are born of the collision between the force of chance and algorithmic pre-diction. As a result, the paradigm of creativity and art is stripped of its sacred quality: all we can do is imitate earlier, never original gestures. The meaning of an image does not reside in its origin but in its destiny. To an extent, everything is a manifestation of déjà-vu."*

## death coach interview  
"the way we approach the idea of dying and how close we are with it can change the way we live in the present . In the same way, if we could come closer to the idea of ‘losing' nature and see it as a ’moral' temporary phase which at some point be transformed to something else, we might then be able to have a different, liberated relationship with our surroundings."  

- `What do you think on the above idea?`   

*I also believe that having a relationship with death, and being conscious of our own mortality, changes our relationship to life and how we show up in the present moment. Memento Mori, the Latin phrase meaning “we must die” indicates that historically and also across cultures, this knowing has held much significance.*   

- `In what ways can we individually but also collectively change our approach towards death? Do you think it can be implemented in educational frameworks?`    

*I think learning about death in multiple capacities can and should be implemented in educational frameworks. Late industrial capitalism has largely eroded the norm of multigenerational families, where babies and children, young adults, and elders all exist together. In a multigenerational family or community structure, young people are exposed to and included in the cycle of life as part of the daily order. This is how people have been educated about death for millenia: by witnessing it, and learning and participating in the rituals that honour it. Recent developments of senior assisted living facilities and nursing homes have taken elders out of domestic life and placed them into institutionalized, medicalized care, and largely out of sight of younger generations. Similarly, the rise of funeral homes have institutionalized–and capitalized–on death, and taken a domestic event (vigil, wake, memorial) out of the home.*  

*One way to educate people about death is through generational knowledge and tradition, and, if not multigenerational families, then multigenerational relationships more broadly. These could be familial, community, or educational relationships. However, many of those communication bridges have been broken, in part due to the systems our society has created to contain elders and death. I think it is part of our work–individual and collective both–to re-establish intergenerational connections.*   

*Beyond this, educating about death in an institutionalized way, like through the public education system for instance, would be a valuable addition to school curriculum–age appropriate of course (although determining this, or agreeing on it, could be a difficult task!). This could include practical information about estates, taxes, and laws (Math and/or Social Studies curriculum), and the physical process & stages of death (Health curriculum), as well as mindfulness and meditation practices (not sure where schools are putting these into the curricula now but they are entering, which is a great start), and cultural traditions (Social Studies/History).*  
*This change, as all changes, needs to be implemented both individually and collectively, simultaneously, over time.*

- `Can near-death experiences become inspiration besides trauma? How can we open new pathways of knowledge and understanding, and have intentional out-of-body experiences in alternative / legal ways?`  

*Gabor Maté is well known for saying that “Trauma is not what happens to you, but what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.” Near death experiences may only be traumatic if there are not adequate resources to process and integrate the experience. These resources could be practical, emotional, relational, and more. Because there is so much collective fear around death, and focus on living at all costs, folks who have a near death experience may not get the emotional and relational support that they need to understand what happened to them from a perspective that isn’t fearful.*  

*There are some archives of accounts by people who have had near death and out of body experiences. I’m thinking particularly of the first episode in the Netflix docuseries “Surviving Death”, which interviews some people about their experiences, but there are many others, especially in book form. The other episodes in the series each focus on different aspects of the life-death continuum and are all worth watching. What I appreciate about the series is its seeming intention to dispel fear around death and dying, rather than to perpetuate it. For those of us who haven’t had a near death experience, or for those of us who haven’t died yet (the latter of which is all of us–ha), how we view and understand the event might have much to do with how we are first introduced to the idea. Part of the importance of educating about death, especially from early childhood, is around dispelling fears around it.*  

*Meditators have been having intentional in-body and out-of-body experiences for millenia. As you likely know, there are numerous texts, hailing from many traditions, written about the methods for achieving these states, probably accessible in our preferred reading language. There’s a lot there to unpack around issues of privilege and appropriation. That said, I think that having a meditation practice–learning how to manipulate consciousness through focused awareness–is a universally important preparation for death.*  

- `When practicing the coaching, do you prepare people by getting them through the stages of dying? Like ’simulating’  it somehow? What is the goal and what is the profile of the people who usually approach you?`  

*With the clients who work with me in my capacity as an end of life doula, yes, I educate about the stages of the dying process. I don’t simulate this with them; rather, I communicate the stages in simple, succinct language, sometimes more than once (one of the ways we learn is by repetition). I also facilitate yoga nidra (yogic sleep) meditations for my clients. The practice of yoga nidra contains several consciousness exercises. I don’t view any of these exercises as a simulation of death either, but I do see them as preparations.*   

*The people who work with me have diverse, and often multiple goals, which include but are not limited to: starting or completing practical affairs and the creation of end of life / death documents (medical and financial power of attorney, advance healthcare directive, will); navigating decisions for physical care at the end of life or plans for after death; resolving emotional baggage; setting personal or professional goals for the remaining time alive; making legacy gifts; developing a spiritual practice or awareness; and the act of dying itself, to which I come as a witness.*

- `In some yoga practices they believe that if one can attain deep lucidity in dreams and in life, when death comes they will be prepared. What u think of that? Is death a conscious disembodied experience?`  

*I don’t feel I can speak to the piece on lucidity in dreams preparing someone for death, but as I have said, I do believe that meditation practices are important preparations for death. I think that if meditation can become a normal and regular state for people to achieve in life, it will be accessible to us in the moments of our approaching death. More than that, I think we can’t expect to achieve a meditative state at the moment of death if we don’t know what that feels like and how to enter it.*  

*Recently I heard a theory (I’m sorry I can’t recall the source) that we experience death based on what we believe about it–that literally the vision of death that we have in our minds becomes the reality we each experience. This suggests that ultimately everyone’s experience of death will be unique. This seems plausible to me, based both on the immense diversity of all other recorded human experiences, no matter how universal the event, and on the image-making machinery of the brain and eyes–eyes capture light only, and all images are produced in the brain and projected outward. If I follow this theory, I realize that I should really make some conscious choices about what I believe about death, which necessarily involves interrogating everything that I have learned about it from the dominant culture.*  

*I think that death can be a conscious experience, but we must practice for it. And when death is a conscious experience, when consciousness is aware of itself, the experience of death, I expect, would not be a disembodied experience, but rather a disembodying experience, in which consciousness maintains itself and awareness of itself before, during, and after it exits the body. The premise for this is embodiment, in which the body is acknowledged as an intelligent container of consciousness.*
