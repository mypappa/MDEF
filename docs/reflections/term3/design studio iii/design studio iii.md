what are the roles I would like to have in it?  

when I try to picture me as a professional, I always see myself as part of a small and strongly bonded community. So my visionary role can be analysed on two levels:  
one in direct contact with my closed circle and the the one of me out to the world.  

## what have i done so far  

without the intention of putting my whole cv in this space, i think it will help the process to hav a rough overview of my experiences so far..

## reflection on past experiences  
Reflecting on my past experiences, I've realized that my best moments in terms of creative work were when I was a student. I had no limits, a flexible schedule, and worked with a team that complemented my skills and energy, allowing for comfortable communication. However, my creative work hasn't been as successful in my professional life. Instead, I've discovered that my strengths lie in supervision, people management, and communication. This realization was surprising given my antisocial tendencies, but I found that taking on a role with clear objectives and goals helped me to communicate more effectively.

Considering these past experiences, there are a few possible futures for my professional life. I could focus on finding a role that allows for creative work in a similar environment to that of a student, such as seeking out positions that offer flexibility and collaboration with a chosen team. Alternatively, I may want to explore roles that build on my strengths in supervision, people management, and communication. This could involve pursuing management or leadership positions within my current field or even considering a career change to a role that aligns with these strengths.

Ultimately, I know that my past experiences and strengths can inform my future choices, but they don't necessarily limit them. I may find that a combination of both creative work and people management is the right fit for me or that a completely different path emerges
