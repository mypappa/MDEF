discussions about ethics in all areas have always attracted my interest.  
I was very happy to attend this design ethics course with Ariel, as it brought many new topics and ideas about emerging technologies and facilitated space for fruitful discourses. 

What I have realised from my engagement in borderline ethical debates so far is that the deeper you analyse a topic, the more it turnes out as a philosophical discouse where there 'right' and 'wrong' because blurry and hard to objectively define.     

"guns don't kill people. people kill people"  

this statement triggered a dialogue during class that got me thinking.  

The argument suggests that the problem of gun violence is not caused by guns themselves, but by the people who use them. Therefore guns are merely tools that can be used for good or bad purposes, depending on the intentions and actions of the person holding them. If guns are taken away or heavily regulated, it will not necessarily prevent people from committing acts of violence. Instead, addressing the root causes of violent behavior (such as mental illness, poverty, or societal factors), is a more effective approach to reducing gun violence.

On the other hand, the availability of guns can make it easier for people to commit acts of violence, and that some types of guns are designed specifically for killing or causing harm. Yes, people make guns and then people use those guns and eventually people kill people. But this is a nihilistic and oversimplified approach that implies that in the end nothing kills people besides people, same as atomic bombs, so it is pointless for society to forbid anything.   


DBS: Deep Brain Stimulation

during the class we came accross the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), which I had not heard of before.  It is a surgical procedure that involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals to specific areas of the brain, which can help regulate and modulate brain activity. 

Besides all the surgical risks it carries, it involves some very 'disturbing' side effects as the loss of personality and of sense of self. how and when are patients able to provide informed consent? what happens in particular cases where the patient has a cognitive impairment or mental illness?  

My approach at the end of day in such questions is that technology can not be stopped and we have to start the debate by accepting this as a starting point. what sounds scary today, in a few years might be the norm and it is a waste of time trying to defeat it.  

A very clear example that I have in mind and my mother told me many years ago is the train. When it was first announced to the world that this long and fast vehicle would be the mode of transportation in the future, people called it "the asphalt devil". at the time it seemed such a dangerous and scary scenario and now it almost sounds like a joke. of course the train has caused many accidents and loss of life. But the way to move forward, in my opinion, is to constantly reshape and optimize the context in which it operates, rather than fighting for its primary existence.
