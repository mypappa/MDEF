'Intelligence' has been defined in many ways:*the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving*.  
More generally, it can be described as the *ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.*  
However, the human perception of intelligence is quite limited: We think that it is only what happens inside the brains. Only the past few years did I realise that intelligence happens **everywhere**. In our mind, our bodies, our movements, our communities, our surroundings.
