discussions about ethics in all areas have always attracted my interest.  
I was very happy to attend this design ethics course with Ariel, as it brought many new topics and ideas about emerging technologies and facilitated space for fruitful discourses. 

What I have realised from my engagement in borderline ethical debates so far is that the deeper you analyse a topic, the more it turnes out as a philosophical discouse where there 'right' and 'wrong' because blurry and hard to objectively define.     

"guns don't kill people. people kill people"  

this statement triggered a dialogue during class that got me thinking.  

The argument suggests that the problem of gun violence is not caused by guns themselves, but by the people who use them. Therefore guns are merely tools that can be used for good or bad purposes, depending on the intentions and actions of the person holding them. If guns are taken away or heavily regulated, it will not necessarily prevent people from committing acts of violence. Instead, addressing the root causes of violent behavior (such as mental illness, poverty, or societal factors), is a more effective approach to reducing gun violence.

On the other hand, the availability of guns can make it easier for people to commit acts of violence, and that some types of guns are designed specifically for killing or causing harm. Yes, people make guns and then people use those guns and eventually people kill people. But this is a nihilistic and oversimplified approach that implies that in the end nothing kills people besides people, same as atomic bombs, so it is pointless for society to forbid anything.   


DBS: Deep Brain Stimulation

during the class we came accross the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), which I had not heard of before.  It is a surgical procedure that involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals to specific areas of the brain, which can help regulate and modulate brain activity. 

Besides all the surgical risks it carries, it involves some very 'disturbing' side effects as the loss of personality and of sense of self. how and when are patients able to provide informed consent? what happens in particular cases where the patient has a cognitive impairment or mental illness?   

My approach at the end of day in such questions is that technology can not be stopped and we have to start the debate by accepting this as a starting point. what sounds scary today, in a few years might be the norm and it is a waste of time trying to defeat it.  

A very clear example that I have in mind and my mother told me many years ago is the train. When it was first announced to the world that this long and fast vehicle would be the mode of transportation in the future, people called it "the asphalt devil". at the time it seemed such a dangerous and scary scenario and now it almost sounds like a joke. of course the train has caused many accidents and loss of life. But the way to move forward, in my opinion, is to constantly reshape and optimize the context in which it operates, rather than fighting for its primary existence.     

I also found very interesting the snoo bassinet that is supposed to simulate the parent’s closeness and ‘help’ the parents rest.   
I am a person not very easily disturbed by these upcoming technologies since I think that we all tend to dislike what it strange to our familiarities. we tend to cancel what is threatening to disturb our status quo and deny the reality of change. but change will happen either we want it or not. and this is why i am very skeptical with criticism of technological ‘inhumane innovations’. (still don’t have an opinion about the bassinet - when and if i have children I will consider :p)  

Another point, having lived in the Netherlands in the past, I was quite familiar with some examples we saw like the fly in the toilets, the ‘wilt u zitten? ik kan staan’, the ‘empty’ roundabout, the water saving shower and more. still, seeing them from this lens and talking about it with all these different people and cultures gave me a new perspective.  

I can comment on almost every single point of this presentation, either directly or indirectly, i believe it is very relevant to our masters. One idea that has stayed with me is the need to move beyond a binary view of technology as separate from nature. in the presentation but also in most talks I come across nowadays that talk about technological impacts and so on, imply quite strongly a very binary distinction of ‘technology’ vs ‘nature’ which I don’t see that way anymore. As and extension of Donna Harraway’s ‘natureculture’ concept, I similarly recognise the inseparability of technology here· as an integral part of our world and recognize the importance of understanding the complex relationships between humans, nature, and technology. I do not have any practical suggestions but I wanted to point out that all these talks imply and reinforce the dualisms which I think is high time for us to dissolve.   

Overall, I am grateful for the insights and discussions that this course has sparked, and I hope to continue exploring these ideas further in the future
