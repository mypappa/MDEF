*"Ecstatic dance is a form of dance in which the dancers, without the need to follow specific steps, abandon themselves to the rhythm and move freely as the music takes them, leading to trance and a feeling of ecstasy."*

Hermetic Spirituality and Altered states of Knowledge  
by Prof. dr. Wouter Hanegraaff | 20/10/2022  

- *"Techniques for altering consciousness leads to different states of knowledge"*  
- *"In order to regain the perfect cosmic consciousness you have to be reborn"*  
- *'Nous' doesn’t mean knowledge. It’s our spiritual capacity to experience the universe of light.*  
- *'Logos' is energy*
- *"Hermeticism, although it existed as a "mystic religious" movement, does not have as its foundation faith but in research. It advocates the knowledge of the Divine (God) as the supreme good, and in contrast, the "ignorance of the Divine" as the deepest misery of the soul."*  


## [brain(s)](https://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/brains/237851)   `exhibition`   

- spiders  
*"Spiders from different species have spun interconnecting webs in the same space, bridging the architecture of each other's webs and telling a story of hybrid relationships. The webs serve as an extension of the spiders' sensorial and cognitive systems where lines of communication merge and connect.(..)Engaging in those collaborative relationships and creative dynamics is a way of attuning to others' Umwelten - or 'self-centred' world - and moving towards novel ways of living together."*   

- interactive installation   
*"Consciousness extends outside the brain in the form of cultural prostheses, such as writing, art, music and other symbolic structures"*  

- collective intelligence  
*"Ant and termite colonies have been dubbed 'superorganisms. These societies grow and develop, have memory and learning, an extended mind (their nests) and affect ecosystems across continents."*  

- déjà-Vu  
*"An algorithm determines the patterns that are repeated more frequently in the collection..the most interesting thing about this generative process is the errors made by the system itself: the random trials, the failed tests, the unforeseeable rejects, in short, the technological subconscious that emerges through the accidents. A machine- fabricated imaginary generates strange, sometimes dreamlike, often surreal results: creations our imagination could not anticipate and which are born of the collision between the force of chance and algorithmic pre-diction. As a result, the paradigm of creativity and art is stripped of its sacred quality: all we can do is imitate earlier, never original gestures. The meaning of an image does not reside in its origin but in its destiny. To an extent, everything is a manifestation o*f déjà-vu."*
