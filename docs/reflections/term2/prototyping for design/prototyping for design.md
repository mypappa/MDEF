`Set the rules or parametric constraints that could allow you to represent this jummy croissant in a digital medium.`  
`- explain what you understand of what is parametric`  
`- define the set of rules to represent the figure`

Without much scientific support, the way I understand the term "parametric" is as a method of describing a subject that carries its relationships and interdependencies with other objects of the same system.
