Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component
Prototyping the design itself
Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry
Prototyping objects that will later contribute / form the design. Instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena
Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype
ex: showroom, exhibition, interactive process that gives information about the development
Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry
The research method: Can be used in a participatory workshop


Looking back to my experience in design, I can recall using some of the above roles of prototyping, mostly during my studies in architecture. I was not used to the term 'prototyping', but while processing the meaning its potential roles, I have several experiences that match the categories.

1. The role 1, which is maybe the most self-referential role, has not been one of my main practice tools since the projects I worked were usually in a non-prototypable scale. Nevertheless, at the 3rd year of my studies I participated in an extracurricular workshop for the design and manufacture of wooden benches in the exterior of the university. During the manufacturing process we tested the materials, the dimensions and proportions of the wooden planks, the amount and place of screws and other practical details. We were able to get instant feedback from the people passing by and test its durability before the final assembly.

2. For my thesis project I used the role 2 of prototyping in order to collect more information about the city. The biggest part of the project was research, as we were dealing with much complex areas (archaeology, cement factory, forest department and more). Not knowing yet what was the purpose of the project or what it was going to look like, we created a questionnaire in order to collect more data. We knew the issues that we wanted to address, but not the actual purpose of our design so we wanted to know the public's views on the matter. Our topic was the environmental crisis, so we took advantage of a public demonstration happening on a specific day and went in the streets with 200 printed questionnaires, asking people to participate. The project took a radical turn which was indirectly related to the outcomes of that day.

Another experience of working with the 2nd role was within the course "Structural [Trans]-Formations". The course objective was to explore the structural concept of a ‘lightweight’ structure that will host a performance event. The course attempted to approach the structural concept as a design resource and investigate the physical model as a tool for diagrammatic reasoning. The study was systematically recorded in the form of a digital diary (blog) in order to demonstrate alternatives and justify final choices.

Of course, I have worked in several physical and digital models, which would match the role 3 of prototyping, the research archetype. From the first to the last year of my studies and my professional experience I got involved in multiple types of modelling:

- working models; made out of inferior materials (foam, paper, cardboard) and simple tools (cutter, scissors, pencils) which mainly served the purpose of shaping the volume.
- concept / interpretative models; made out of all kinds of materials and colours (from glitter to coffee beans) which were used as mediums to communicate the concept / story / idea.
- final models; carefully made with high quality materials (plexiglass, balsa, grass, puppets) and tools (laser cutter, 3d printers,..)

At the 5th year of studies, within the Design Studio "City of Rooms" we curated an exhibition in a public gallery presenting the projects of the students. The exhibits were multikind (drawings, models, concepts, videos) and later became objects of discussion among the visitors: professors, students, student's families and all the public participated in the discussion. As the exhibition took place in the middle of the semester, we then had the chance to use the feedback in to further developing our designs.

Finally, my experience in the 4th role of prototyping was within the course "NARRATIVE TRAILS: Designing [for] the Pelion hiking trails". The course was about mapping of a thematic route and then design and construct an outdoor small-scale intervention. Along the process, we designed multiple different sizes and versions for the game design (board, floor, wearable) which we tested with our classmates real-time. We ended up 'wrapping' the game around tree trunks. The game consisted of cards with figures designed by a local artist and the goal was to place the cards in the right position, according to the hints. The passengers could play while taking a break from their hike and at the same time get useful information about the culture of the trail.
