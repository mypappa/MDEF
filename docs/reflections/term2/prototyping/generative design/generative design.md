this challenge seemed like a nice opportunity to give another chance to me and grasshopper. Coming from an architecture school, we had some minimal interaction before but always thought there is potential for us two, with or without the role of an architect. And so it happened.  

I wanted to model something organic, but with a 'technological' twist. so I found on youtube a tutorial of a tree-like shape, which reminded me of a tornado, a structural column, or a rose flower.  

The tutorial was quite advanced -for my level- but I really enjoyed re-discovering some of the endless possibilities of grasshopper!  

the most frustrating part was the plug-ins... most tutorials that i watched included many components that don't come together with the grasshopper and it is not mentioned in advance.  

Even if most of the plug-ins are open source, they are only available for a Windows operating system, which I don't have. Thankfully though I had easy access to an old windows laptop at home, so I managed to download the 'Kangaroo' and the 'lunchbox' in that one. after some transferring back and forth to different computers, there I had my baked model!  

The fun part of parametric design though is after its (more or less) done. Playing with the sliders and transforming the whole body of the model, fine tuning all its components with no orderÂ· I could jump from the first to the last one in an 'anarchic' way, without losing any of the interrelationships.  

so here is the result..
