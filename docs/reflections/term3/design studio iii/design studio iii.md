what are the roles I would like to have in it?  

when I try to picture me as a professional, I always see myself as part of a small and strongly bonded community. So my visionary role can be analysed on two levels:  
one in direct contact with my closed circle and the the one of me out to the world.  

## what have i done so far  
2013-2019 student of architecture school - six years  
2018 intern in a small architectural office in Athens - two months  
2019-2020 intern in a architecture studio in Rotterdam - one year  
2021 dog training assistant - six months  
2022 junior architect in architecture office in Athens - two months  
2023 construction site supervisor - six months  
2018-2023 on-off assistant of my mother's architecture freelance work - many years  
2022-2023 student in MDEF - six year  

## reflection on past experiences  
in terms of creative work, my best moments were with the role of the student: no limits, flexible time schedule, chosen team to team-work which means comfortable communication, complementary skills and energies..  

on a professional level, however, this part of me hasn't worket out that well. after trying different roles i discovered another role: supervision, people management and communication. being a relatively antisocial person, it came as a surprise. the explanation i came up with is that "putting myself out there" and interacting with random people as myself is different than taking on a role and having clear objectives and goals out of the communication.  
summing up, i think my two roles are the following:  
creative director
