In the same way, if we could come closer to the idea of \u2018losing\u2019 nature and see it as a \u2019moral\u2019 temporary phase which at some point be transformed to something else, we might then be able to have a different, liberated relationship with our surroundings.\u201d What do you think on the above idea? I also believe that having a relationship with death, and being conscious of our own mortality, changes our relationship to life and how we show up in the present moment. Memento Mori, the Latin phrase meaning \u201cwe must die\u201d indicates that historically and also across cultures, this knowing has held much significance. In what ways can we individually but also collectively change our approach towards death? Do you think it can be implemented in educational frameworks? I think learning about death in multiple capacities can and should be implemented in educational frameworks. Late industrial capitalism has largely eroded the norm of multigenerational families, where babies and children, young adults, and elders all exist together. In a multigenerational family or community structure, young people are exposed to and included in the cycle of life as part of the daily order. This is how people have been educated about death for millenia: by witnessing it, and learning and participating in the rituals that honour it. Recent developments of senior assisted living facilities and nursing homes have taken elders out of domestic life and placed them into institutionalized, medicalized care, and largely out of sight of younger generations. Similarly, the rise of funeral homes have institutionalized\u2013and capitalized\u2013on death, and taken a domestic event (vigil, wake, memorial) out of the home. One way to educate people about death is through generational knowledge and tradition, and, if not multigenerational families, then multigenerational relationships more broadly. These could be familial, community, or educational relationships. However, many of those communication bridges have been broken, in part due to the systems our society has created to contain elders and death. I think it is part of our work\u2013individual and collective both\u2013to re-establish intergenerational connections. Beyond this, educating about death in an institutionalized way, like through the public education system for instance, would be a valuable addition to school curriculum\u2013age appropriate of course (although determining this, or agreeing on it, could be a difficult task!). This could include practical information about estates, taxes, and laws (Math and/or Social Studies curriculum), and the physical process & stages of death (Health curriculum), as well as mindfulness and meditation practices (not sure where schools are putting these into the curricula now but they are entering, which is a great start), and cultural traditions (Social Studies/History). This change, as all changes, needs to be implemented both individually and collectively, simultaneously, over time. Can near-death experiences become inspiration besides trauma? How can we open new pathways of knowledge and understanding, and have intentional out-of-body experiences in alternative / legal ways? Gabor Mat\u00e9 is well known for saying that \u201cTrauma is not what happens to you, but what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.\u201d Near death experiences may only be traumatic if there are not adequate resources to process and integrate the experience. These resources could be practical, emotional, relational, and more. Because there is so much collective fear around death, and focus on living at all costs, folks who have a near death experience may not get the emotional and relational support that they need to understand what happened to them from a perspective that isn\u2019t fearful. There are some archives of accounts by people who have had near death and out of body experiences. I\u2019m thinking particularly of the first episode in the Netflix docuseries \u201cSurviving Death\u201d, which interviews some people about their experiences, but there are many others, especially in book form. The other episodes in the series each focus on different aspects of the life-death continuum and are all worth watching. What I appreciate about the series is its seeming intention to dispel fear around death and dying, rather than to perpetuate it. For those of us who haven\u2019t had a near death experience, or for those of us who haven\u2019t died yet (the latter of which is all of us\u2013ha), how we view and understand the event might have much to do with how we are first introduced to the idea. Part of the importance of educating about death, especially from early childhood, is around dispelling fears around it. Meditators have been having intentional in-body and out-of-body experiences for millenia. As you likely know, there are numerous texts, hailing from many traditions, written about the methods for achieving these states, probably accessible in our preferred reading language. There\u2019s a lot there to unpack around issues of privilege and appropriation. That said, I think that having a meditation practice\u2013learning how to manipulate consciousness through focused awareness\u2013is a universally important preparation for death. When practicing the coaching, do you prepare people by getting them through the stages of dying? Like \u2019simulating\u2019 it somehow? What is the goal and what is the profile of the people who usually approach you? With the clients who work with me in my capacity as an end of life doula, yes, I educate about the stages of the dying process. I don\u2019t simulate this with them; rather, I communicate the stages in simple, succinct language, sometimes more than once (one of the ways we learn is by repetition). I also facilitate yoga nidra (yogic sleep) meditations for my clients. The practice of yoga nidra contains several consciousness exercises. I don\u2019t view any of these exercises as a simulation of death either, but I do see them as preparations. The people who work with me have diverse, and often multiple goals, which include but are not limited to: starting or completing practical affairs and the creation of end of life / death documents (medical and financial power of attorney, advance healthcare directive, will); navigating decisions for physical care at the end of life or plans for after death; resolving emotional baggage; setting personal or professional goals for the remaining time alive; making legacy gifts; developing a spiritual practice or awareness; and the act of dying itself, to which I come as a witness. In some yoga practices they believe that if one can attain deep lucidity in dreams and in life, when death comes they will be prepared. What u think of that? Is death a conscious disembodied experience? I don\u2019t feel I can speak to the piece on lucidity in dreams preparing someone for death, but as I have said, I do believe that meditation practices are important preparations for death. I think that if meditation can become a normal and regular state for people to achieve in life, it will be accessible to us in the moments of our approaching death. More than that, I think we can\u2019t expect to achieve a meditative state at the moment of death if we don\u2019t know what that feels like and how to enter it. Recently I heard a theory (I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t recall the source) that we experience death based on what we believe about it\u2013that literally the vision of death that we have in our minds becomes the reality we each experience. This suggests that ultimately everyone\u2019s experience of death will be unique. This seems plausible to me, based both on the immense diversity of all other recorded human experiences, no matter how universal the event, and on the image-making machinery of the brain and eyes\u2013eyes capture light only, and all images are produced in the brain and projected outward. If I follow this theory, I realize that I should really make some conscious choices about what I believe about death, which necessarily involves interrogating everything that I have learned about it from the dominant culture. I think that death can be a conscious experience, but we must practice for it. And when death is a conscious experience, when consciousness is aware of itself, the experience of death, I expect, would not be a disembodied experience, but rather a disembodying experience, in which consciousness maintains itself and awareness of itself before, during, and after it exits the body. The premise for this is embodiment, in which the body is acknowledged as an intelligent container of consciousness.","title":"exploring"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#ecstatic-dance-participation","text":"\u201cEcstatic dance is a form of dance in which the dancers, without the need to follow specific steps, abandon themselves to the rhythm and move freely as the music takes them, leading to trance and a feeling of ecstasy.\u201d","title":"ecstatic dance    participation"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#time-zero-challenge","text":"visit the \u201cliving with your own ideas\u201d section or simply click on the title for more details","title":"time-zero   challenge"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#hermetic-spirituality-lecture","text":"Hermetic Spirituality and Altered states of Knowledge by Prof. dr.

Nothing is connected to everything; everything is connected to something\u201d \u2013 Donna Haraway Even though we live in the age of information and polyphony, few voices are being noticed; few stories are being created. This paper reflects on the importance of creating and listening to stories. Our research focuses on the articulation of fictional narratives that allow to go beyond monophonic and catastrophic narratives. Stories are fiction and they are not; they are speculation yet inherently bear reflection. Anna Tsing talks about stories as forms of \u201cattunement\u201d to the worlds we find ourselves in, which means we have agency to make decisions: What stories do we listen to? What channels do we use to tell and who is telling? With this research, we aim to develop a method that helps diversify narratives about the future by providing space and showing possibilities for storytelling. We see it as important to diversify narratives by transgressing the monophony of imagining the future. This seems possible through democratizing storytelling by pointing out that everyone is capable of telling stories and asking questions \u2013 we are active agents who can question narratives and imagine alternatives. Speculative fiction appears as a tool that can be learned and practiced. Based on Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of a \u201cmesh\u201d that represents the interrelations between human and \u201cnonhuman\u201d realities, we propose to use a mapping technique that decenters the self and creates space for entangled narratives to evolve.

It is a Saturday morning; we are meeting in the studio of our friend and mentor Jana in Raval. We have invited for 11 o clock, by 11:30 we are all together, had some tea and fruit and are coming together to stand in a circle. A short introduction round makes us realize the bubble we are in. Amanda from the States, a MDEF student who is interested in the creation of a makerspace and who loves the self-sufficiency of coding- and electronics. Maria from Italy, who is one of the inviters roommates and works in the social sector with people with disabilities. Nithin from India, who works at Glovo as a UX expert and who is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. Korbi from Switzerland, who is a MDEF Master student and concerned with the exploitation of the labor force and the search for new ways to life without work. Georgio from Switzerland, who is his friend and curious to pass by. Daphne from Greece, who is an ex-MDEF student and after finishing a few years ago continued her journey in future design dealing with system and imaginations of speculating. Quim from Spain, who is a geography professor and artist in Lleida and has various practices that deal with the interaction of space and learning processes. Jana from spain, who is an ex-MDEF student and is interested in transhumanistic ways of thinking and designing. Claudia from Italy, who is a MEDF student and is interested in the change of social behavior towards a more conscious consumption of resources. And the two facilitators Myrto and Stella from Greece and Germany, who are MDEF students and interested in disrupting binary thinkings and exploring polyphonic narration. All in all, we are between 24 and 40 years old, white and somewhat linked to the topic of the invitation \u2013 the educational system and how it is changing. Before introducing the topic and goal of the day, we are asked to close our eyes and settle into our body and into the space we are in. A few guided breathings and we open our eyer again to meet each other in concentration and curiousness. The next few hours will be guided along three phases of transition \u2013 we will unfamiliarize, grief, and rebirth by the help of three exercises. We will be dealing with a transition that is happening and that we all have experienced somehow close or far \u2013 the switch from solely in-person learning and teaching to hybrid forms that come with the introduction of the internet and globally accessible platforms that enable online and live exchanges. We divide into three groups, taking in the perspectives of either teachers, students, or means of communication. Within the groups we discuss and dialogue about what the above mentioned transition would mean for our position, what would change practically and how would it affect our position emotionally? After about half an hour, we meet with the other groups in a standing circle and each group presents its burning issues. A discussion starts to evolve. It seems difficult to argue from the group\u2019s perspective and participants often appeal to their personal interests. For example, does Quim, who choose to represent means of communication, easily fall back into his actual role as a university professor and argues for the perspectives of the teacher. For the students, who all were students at one point in their lives (in this case not even very long ago and mostly still are), the participants refer to lived experiences. A discussion about the differences in legal regulation and the lack of digital skills arises. Soon all three groups agree on the current goals and deficits, which are not compatible with each other. We go into the next phase; After having unfamiliarized with what is known by taking in new perspectives and seeing what else there is at play, we continue into the grieving part. In the same groups we are asked to discuss what heritage we want to pass on, what essential qualities of the roles should not be forgotten but will eventually be something that is no longer practiced. For this phase the facilitators have calculated less time and after 20 min bring back the circle and we exchange the values we will be missing. This leads to a mapping of all the values that seem essential for learning and teaching, even in a digital future. Here, too, personal experiences, fears and desires are referred to and inspire our thoughts and words. Someone mentions the potentiality of hybridness and starts drawing a scenario in which these values can be kept while allowing digital spaces to take over (some of) the physical learning places. We are slowly transitioning into the third phase our day \u2013 the rebirth. Each on themselves now writes down three scenarios on three different papers without disclosing their headings: one desirable future that\u2019s possible, one undesirable future that\u2019s plausible, and one desirable future that\u2019s impossible. The studio with the low ceiling and the cold windows falls silent. We hear the pens on the paper, the teeth biting lips. When the facilitators announce five more minutes there is revolt, there is need for more time. Then we come together and place all our scripts face down on the floor in the middle of our standing circle. One by one we pick up a paper and read out loud what is written on it. Then we decide together if this is something we can imagine in a future education system that has made the transition from exclusively personal learning. There is a lot of movement now, we stand still, but there is laughter and discussion about all kinds of related implications. We discard the papers that are not wanted in our model and in this way build up a stack of propositions describing (parts of) an educational system that we would like to learn and teach with. A third stack of papers is the place for all the scripts we are not so enthusiastic about. The ones where we don\u2019t really know whether to give them a chance or discard them straight away. After three rounds, and many repetitions of readings, the floor in our midst is empty again. It is getting late, and as the participants have to leave at 2pm, we are led again into a closed-eye breathing, to ourselves and the space, before some words of gratitude end the session for the day. People leave slowly, some stay, eat some more fruit and share their experiences. critique After letting some time pass, we look back with a more critical eye on our experience. .. what we were expecting to happen vs what actually happened? .. what would we do differently next time? .. what we would like to maintain? \u2026? to have some structure here we will first identify all the actors, then reflect on each one of them but also in the togetherness: facilitators (us) tools (cards, pens and papers) physical space (Jana\u2019s studio) day and time (Saturday 11am) topic of discussion(online education) workshop format participants The group of people we managed to gather was good in terms of size for such a collective process. The so-called \u2018diversity\u2019 was there and there was not. We somewhat had different backgrounds, different ethnicities, lifestyles etc but in regard to the topic we were more or less aligned. Our generations were also quite close so we had no representative of an \u2018extreme\u2019: a person who never used video for education or a person who never experienced education without it. In terms of social interaction, there was no representation of people with any kind of \u2018social disorders\u2019. we also noticed a lack of imagination beyond rational thinking, but maybe this part was due to our handling. facilitators We were (are) new in organizing and instructing workshops so we didn\u2019t spend too much time preparing it, since it was our first experiment. Also we were not really able / we didn\u2019t want to forcefully guide it to a certain direction since we hadn\u2019t specified our goals. We were going with the flow, taking care of the place and our invitees. We didn\u2019t take risks nor improvisations, so maybe next we try out something more radical. Also on my personal side, I wasn\u2019t able to take a more active communicator\u2019s role especially in the beginning for whatever reasons (!) but I will do try better next time. tools The instructions cards we had prepared with the laser cutter were pretty but for the use we needed them, not so functional. They were not readable from a distance and not enough to give a pair to each group or individual. As for the participant\u2019s inputs, it was mostly verbal so pens and papers were more than enough. Maybe next time if we try a more multimedia creation, we can try more tools like paintings, recorders, ipads,\u2026 space I think we were all quite happy with the place. Very convenient location (especially for me hehe), nice atmosphere and very hosbitable environment. The space had everything we needed or might need in the future. moving tables, kitchen, bathroom, even a small fab lab. Also people were working in the background, which added an interesting co-living aspect. day and time worked well. Saturday people usually don\u2019t work and it was not too early (so that people could rest after Friday evening), not too late (so people could still enjoy their Saturday afterwards). the duration maybe was a little too long, especially the last part. It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if it had lasted more because people were engaging, but in our case it lasted because we had to \u2018finish\u2019 reading and categorizing all the cards.. topic of discussion The transition from an in-person education to an online format was a topic we thought is good because everyone had some experience. The problem is, it has already happened. It is still changing of course but it\u2019s too much of our reality to trigger interesting, speculative, fictional discussions about an unknown future. Pretty much, the hybrid form we overall agreed on is part of our daily lives already. workshop format The creative part was somewhat sidelined. We exchanged / shared our visions but we left it there. I would have liked to collectively ideate, using our individual visions as a starting point and together come up with narratives that no one had already in mind before coming to the workshop.","title":"practising"},{"location":"process/practising/practising/#open-dialogue","text":"","title":"open dialogue"},{"location":"process/practising/practising/#conference","text":"imaginar mundos posibles : Potencialidades, l\u00edmites y fricciones de la ficci\u00f3n especulativa en la investigaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n","title":"conference"},{"location":"process/practising/practising/#our-paper-introduction","text":"Story-taling January 19 th and 20 th , 2023 Keywords: storytelling, speculating futures, decentering, diversifying narratives \u201cNobody lives everywhere; everybody lives somewhere. Nothing is connected to everything; everything is connected to something\u201d \u2013 Donna Haraway Even though we live in the age of information and polyphony, few voices are being noticed; few stories are being created. This paper reflects on the importance of creating and listening to stories. Our research focuses on the articulation of fictional narratives that allow to go beyond monophonic and catastrophic narratives. Stories are fiction and they are not; they are speculation yet inherently bear reflection. Anna Tsing talks about stories as forms of \u201cattunement\u201d to the worlds we find ourselves in, which means we have agency to make decisions: What stories do we listen to? What channels do we use to tell and who is telling? With this research, we aim to develop a method that helps diversify narratives about the future by providing space and showing possibilities for storytelling. We see it as important to diversify narratives by transgressing the monophony of imagining the future. This seems possible through democratizing storytelling by pointing out that everyone is capable of telling stories and asking questions \u2013 we are active agents who can question narratives and imagine alternatives. Speculative fiction appears as a tool that can be learned and practiced. Based on Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of a \u201cmesh\u201d that represents the interrelations between human and \u201cnonhuman\u201d realities, we propose to use a mapping technique that decenters the self and creates space for entangled narratives to evolve. The mapping involves the overlay of individual observations of the relations between (non-human) agents in a given space. In the course of this process, a \u201cmesh\u201d emerges and participants are encouraged to speculate about fictional scenarios that play out in this \u201cweb of life\u201d.","title":"our paper - introduction"},{"location":"process/practising/practising/#cartographies","text":"our plan with Stella here was to visit a specific ecosystem and create some collective mappings of the actors and their interactions. we could not define it more specifically even if we did some more practical research so our initial plan has not worked so far.

Many new questions were raised: How can we bring ourselves closer to our subconscious and the richness of information that is there encrypted? How is the cognitive gap between the areas of our brain related to the humanitarian conflicts? How could instinctive negative or aggressive emotions be dismantled ?

I Realized that it somehow connects with my initial fight about the illusionary world and the filter bubbles from the atlas. It\u2019s all about going deeper in knowing and understanding. Many new questions were raised: How can we bring ourselves closer to our subconscious and the richness of information that is there encrypted? How is the cognitive gap between the areas of our brain related to the humanitarian conflicts? How could instinctive negative or aggressive emotions be dismantled ? How can technology help to all that? I might be getting into deep waters with no background whatsoever and I don\u2019t know where this will take me, but I know I am curious and excited to explore it as much as I can.","title":"board timeline"},{"location":"reflections/term1/bio%26agrizero/03-Bio%20%26%20Agri%20Zero/","text":"bio & agri zero \u00b6 track: Exploration experiments \u00b6 Drying the auxetic sterile dishes During the course we had the chance to perform our own DIY experiments in the classroom in order to apply the theory we were taught in practice.

Gould, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, had read a 2014 study that found the presence of men, but not women, dulls mice\u2019s pain, and according to a university news release, his team also heard anecdotes from other labs about experimental results that seemed to be influenced by researcher sex. So they decided to test whether this could explain the inconsistencies they saw, since they couldn\u2019t replicate their experiments. The team reported in an August 30 Nature Neuroscience paper that the sex of researchers working with mice did indeed influence outcomes involving ketamine treatment, with the scent of human males triggering the release of a hormone in mice\u2019s brains that enabled the drug to work as an antidepressant. The findings suggest that researcher sex may confound animal research in a variety of experiments . \u201cOur findings in mice suggests that activating a specific stress circuit in the brain may be a way to improve ketamine treatment\u201d Gould says in the university announcement. The researchers also delved into the mechanisms behind that effect, and found that when men administered ketamine to the mice, a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was released in an area of the mouse hippocampus associated with depression, enabling the ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effect. This didn\u2019t happen when women administered the drug unless they accompanied the ketamine with a dose of CRF. Gerlinde Metz of the University of Lethbridge in Canada tells New Scientist that researcher sex is just one of many variables that can affect animal experiments; others include their shipment to the lab, diet, and even the season. She says researchers should try to control for the effects of these variables as best they can, although it may be impossible to do so completely.\u201d https://www.newscientist.com/article/2337160-the-sex-of-the-researcher-can-influence-results-of-mouse-experiments/ https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/sex-of-researcher-influences-ketamine-s-effects-in-mice-study-70468 article reflection \u00b6 When I read the title of this article, at first it caught my attention because of the statement. The human\u2019s gender role in mice experiments sounds definitely an unexpected and interesting observation, so as the possible benefits to the medicine\u2019s effect in humans. But this was not the reason I chose this article for the assignment. From the very first until the last day of the course Nuria was strongly stressing out the importance of keeping track of the experiment\u2019s conditions, like any slight modification we make in our recipes and keeping track of every single variable that can possibly affect the results.

Not knowing specifically what we were looking for, we walked barefoot around the site, trying understand the dynamics, the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters that live in the area and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage: bones, feathers, droppings and other unspecified objects\u2026 we felt that the area was downgraded and unwelcoming for neither humans nor nun-humans. Interestingly, we were told that its pollution and degradation dates back to the 1960s, mostly due to abandonment and industrialization of the surrounding areas. In 1995 an environmental recovery of the river was initiated, which resulted with the Parque Fluvial del Bes\u00f2 in 2004: a long public green area with space to walk, cycle and practice outdoor sports. augmented creativity \u00b6 what is augmentation? \u00b6 First question that came up was what is augmentation? There are of course many different definitions online, mostly under the term \u2018augmented reality (AR)\u2019 along with \u2018virtual reality (VR)\u2019, but we were more interested in exploring the concept of augmentation in a wider spectrum. We realised that each one in the group had a slightly different idea of what it meant. Personally I perceive augmentation as a distortion or enhancement of existing information: it can be achieved by adding a extra layer of information onto the physical ennvironment, or by removing part of the information and changing the balance of our sensorium. A psychedelic trip, a dream, a video game, or an isolated audio can be all be augmented experiences. Dreaming might actually be a \u2018built-in\u2019 augmented representation of reality. discussions \u00b6 mocap room experiment \u00b6 This experiment was part of our research of the possibility to extend human perspectives to more-than-human ontologies. Until now they made use of sensory systems to create methodologies that help to establish empathy with otherness. The aim was to bring participants into a context from which collaborative practices can integrate the more-than-human and allows to open up space for unheard voices. For our intervention we used water as an example of other entity. We collected words that somehow describe the different forms of water and with them we created short \u2018poems\u2019 about the transitions of the water between solid, liquid and gas. For that we used the haiku Japanese poetic form that consists of three lines, with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern.

Not knowing specifically what we were looking for, we walked barefoot around the site, trying understand the dynamics, the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters that live in the area and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage: bones, feathers, droppings and other unspecified objects\u2026 we felt that the area was downgraded and unwelcoming for neither humans nor nun-humans. Interestingly, we were told that its pollution and degradation dates back to the 1960s, mostly due to abandonment and industrialization of the surrounding areas. In 1995 an environmental recovery of the river was initiated, which resulted with the Parque Fluvial del Bes\u00f2 in 2004: a long public green area with space to walk, cycle and practice outdoor sports.","title":"know thy non-human neighbors"},{"location":"reflections/term1/design%20studio%20i/collective%20interventions/collective%20interventions/#augmented-creativity","text":"","title":"augmented creativity"},{"location":"reflections/term1/design%20studio%20i/collective%20interventions/collective%20interventions/#what-is-augmentation","text":"First question that came up was what is augmentation? There are of course many different definitions online, mostly under the term \u2018augmented reality (AR)\u2019 along with \u2018virtual reality (VR)\u2019, but we were more interested in exploring the concept of augmentation in a wider spectrum. We realised that each one in the group had a slightly different idea of what it meant. Personally I perceive augmentation as a distortion or enhancement of existing information: it can be achieved by adding a extra layer of information onto the physical ennvironment, or by removing part of the information and changing the balance of our sensorium. A psychedelic trip, a dream, a video game, or an isolated audio can be all be augmented experiences. Dreaming might actually be a \u2018built-in\u2019 augmented representation of reality.","title":"what is augmentation?"},{"location":"reflections/term1/design%20studio%20i/collective%20interventions/collective%20interventions/#discussions","text":"","title":"discussions"},{"location":"reflections/term1/design%20studio%20i/collective%20interventions/collective%20interventions/#mocap-room-experiment","text":"This experiment was part of our research of the possibility to extend human perspectives to more-than-human ontologies. Until now they made use of sensory systems to create methodologies that help to establish empathy with otherness. The aim was to bring participants into a context from which collaborative practices can integrate the more-than-human and allows to open up space for unheard voices. For our intervention we used water as an example of other entity. We collected words that somehow describe the different forms of water and with them we created short \u2018poems\u2019 about the transitions of the water between solid, liquid and gas. For that we used the haiku Japanese poetic form that consists of three lines, with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern.

The wearable mask will be tied around and covering my face. It consists of a base made out of plastic bottle covered in a layer of aluminium foil which will be transforming. It works as an extension of the face, like a piece of clothing. It can adapt its surface depending on the situation. What does it notice? It notices my personal needs when interacting with people and transforms the material, the face expressions or any kind of message I want to communicate to the surroundings through its outer layer. What were you thinking? My wishful superpower has always been the ability to disappear and become temporarily invisible. To some extent it is related to my need for control over my appearance, my body, myself. The face is like a screen which projects personal information even in unwanted situations. At the same time, the pure characteristics of the face regardless of the expression can cause prejudiced and biased reactions. My aim was to somehow protect - address - test the above situations on a personal and on a social level. Why does it matter? The \u2018mask\u2019 is a very primitive yet contemporary object with a great history in multiple fields: It can be used an object for performing arts, rituals, punishment, disguise, fashion, hygiene etc. This particular idea of mask attempts to become an integral part of the self in daily life which will open new communication channels with the environment and bring comfort in uncomfortable situations. Companion reflection \u00b6 After wearing the mask and moving around the city for a day, I noticed the following contradictions : - comfort in hiding vs discomfort in breathing - liberating expression vs limiting communication - sense of protection vs opportunity for exposure - attention avoidance (eg random unwanted acquaintances) vs attention catcher (it looks quite creepy) 24h challenge \u00b6 Exercise brief: - How can you take action on your topic in a brave way? - Can you make some small piece of your idea and live with it? - How can you probe the design space through an embodied / first-person exploration? - Can you create a situation that might reveal something new? time-zero \u00b6 According to the task timeframe, we were given one and a half day to complete the exercise, meaning to come up with an idea, start applying it, document it and present it in a 1-minute video. Everything had to be done very quickly, which for me and my personal rhythm was just unimaginable. The topics of my interest (for the moment) are quite abstract, vague and seemingly unrelated to each other. So in order to come up with a concept directly related to my topics and matching the assignment requirements, I needed at least one week. And then another week to plan the application of the idea, and then one more to prepare the video. Obviously this was not even close to possible. Therefore I started thinking in a \u2018reversed\u2019 way: \u2022 What if my biggest struggle on the assignment (and in life) becomes the idea I have been looking for? \u2022 What happens if I act instead of think? \u2022 What would my day look like if I have zero time to think? \u2022 How would I react to my stimuli without any sort of processing? \u2022 Is it possible to forcefully interrupt the thinking process (at least the conscious one) and how can I do it? The moment this idea came to my mind, I immediately started applying it. At the same time, my classmates started asking for help in their own projects. I gave myself 2-3 seconds to decide and reply, which led me to a very intense, uncontrolled and versatile day. I got dressed in 5 seconds to go for padel (I wore my pyjama top). Then I went to the beach where I helped in shooting some videos for other projects. When we finished the shooting I went to Elisava for a quick meeting with Oscar (couldn\u2019t have been long since it would interrupt my no-thinking process). On that moment I realised I hadn\u2019t thought of charging my phone, so my documentation capabilities were also limited. While unceasingly applying this challenge during my day, I also came up with 3 mini-challenges within the main one: \u2022 10-minute weekly groceries \u2022 20-minute nonstop writing \u2022 no recipe fast baking (zero cooking / baking knowledge) At the end of the day I was physically and mentally exhausted. TIME-ZERO challenge by Myrto-Eirini Pappa challenge reflection \u00b6 What did you make? And why did it matter? Taking time to think and process before acting has always been my comfort zone . What I did was an experiment to force myself out of it, to expose my instinctive, unprocessed thoughts and actions. Living in fast-pace and losing control over my life is a great fear and a risk I wouldn\u2019t have taken easily. What happens when you involve yourself? I always thought that my projects were somehow self-involving, because I have always been truthful to what I want to represent. Nevertheless, I realise that I have always been keeping a certain distance from involving my inner self with the fear of getting too self-inclusive. After having performed my first experiment with a deeper self-involvement I value the process differently: there are no longer strong distinctions between the \u2018work\u2019, the \u2018personal life\u2019, the \u2018hobbies\u2019, the \u2018free time\u2019 etc. Everything blends and overlaps with one another, creating a whole interconnected mass. And this feels way more human . What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? When the source of knowledge is your own body, the result is more powerful and long-lasting. It somehow changes a part of your being, and consequently your design practice. The outcome is an authentic, genuine , undeniable point of view which can not be predetermined. Nevertheless there are always two sides: I got passionate and excited but also more frustrated. I was not able to switch to another subject or just take a break since I was the designer and I was the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. Did anything change about your way of working? (still writing) The way \u0399 worked that day was the complete opposite of what I\u2019m used to. I tried to switch from being extremely slow and indecisive, to being extremely fast and direct. What I realised was that \u2018time\u2019 is a luxury which can either reinforce or prevent the project\u2019s development. Having plenty of time can be helpful in building confidence and deeper understanding on the work, but at the same time it might be confusing: Analysing every possibility leads to information overload and procrastination, which misguides and disconnects the project from the original penchant. From my experience, both \u2018extremes\u2019 come with their own set of implications. My goal is to find the right balance between the two and be able to switch modes according to my needs. What does it mean for your future work? After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? to be discovered..","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"track: Reflection","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#invisible-me","text":"Make a living / non-living companion How will you live together?

And this feels way more human . What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? When the source of knowledge is your own body, the result is more powerful and long-lasting. It somehow changes a part of your being, and consequently your design practice. The outcome is an authentic, genuine , undeniable point of view which can not be predetermined. Nevertheless there are always two sides: I got passionate and excited but also more frustrated. I was not able to switch to another subject or just take a break since I was the designer and I was the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. Did anything change about your way of working? (still writing) The way \u0399 worked that day was the complete opposite of what I\u2019m used to. I tried to switch from being extremely slow and indecisive, to being extremely fast and direct. What I realised was that \u2018time\u2019 is a luxury which can either reinforce or prevent the project\u2019s development. Having plenty of time can be helpful in building confidence and deeper understanding on the work, but at the same time it might be confusing: Analysing every possibility leads to information overload and procrastination, which misguides and disconnects the project from the original penchant. From my experience, both \u2018extremes\u2019 come with their own set of implications. My goal is to find the right balance between the two and be able to switch modes according to my needs. What does it mean for your future work? After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? to be discovered..","title":"challenge reflection"},{"location":"reflections/term1/tech%20beyond%20the%20myth/tech%20beyond%20the%20myth/","text":"tech beyond the myth \u00b6 track: Instrumentation 1. disassembling -> identifying \u00b6 The two-week course \u201cTech beyond the myth\u201d started with the intimidating challenge of disassembling an old electronic device, which for my team was two LCD screen monitors: A DELL 2015 and a Philips 2007 model.

This story is about the discovery and creation of fictional narratives, not only as an escape from reality, but also as a way of embracing the post-truth era in which we live.. According to Benedict Anderson, every nation in the world is \u201can imagined political community. each of our countries \u201cis imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion\u201d. Nations are ideas that exist solely in our minds. Ideas we love, ideas that matter, ideas that change and hold up the world. Therefore, it is important to democratise the narrative by pointing out that we are all active agents who can question narratives and imagine alternatives. And to get to the point of open imagination or any altered state of mind, a prior process is necessary; the transition process. The process of transitioning will be interpretively analysed in three different phases and some methodologies of application will be proposed. our non-reality \u00b6 \u201cWith politics going mad, the planet heating up, technology booming, and intolerance rising, it is essential that we don\u2019t forget that reality is just a construction: one we can reimagine, refashion, propose and eventually change.\u201d@Vincenzo Angileri According to scholars from social sciences and anthropology, as citizens of (western) modern societies, we learned to give value and importance to certain things and ignore most of what going on elsewhere \u2013 everything that is not included in the systems we know is unimaginable to us: \u201conly a very small set of things could possibly count as \u2018the future\u2019 and everything else was being blocked out, even though it was going on all around\u201d (Tsing, 2021). By attuning ourselves anew to the worlds we find ourselves in through storytelling, we can integrate all kinds of learnings and technologies that help to emphasise with our surroundings (Tsing, 2021). This means that we don\u2019t necessarily come up with new inventions and ideas, but the new kind of attention we pay to our environment through telling different stories allows us to open our eyes to things we thought were unremarkable and to reshape systems we thought were established. Here \u201c\u2026writing becomes the way of posing the question of how to live [\u2026] a space that generates stories through which a society can examine itself\u201d (Tsing et al., 2017, p. 171). more-than-me \u00b6 Individual perspective is precious yet really dangerous. It is the beginning of our understanding, the catalyst ingredient of our creations. But to move in more dimensions of being, enable communications, interactions and continuations, a single story is not enough. Projecting one\u2019s own experience onto other people, species and entities might lead to a manifestation of justices and injustices, allies and enemies, good and evil. By imagining the future collectively we cannot get completely rid of our blinkers (horse blinders), but combining multiple blinkered visions can create panoramic views. transition process \u00b6 The process of transitioning can be interpreted into a pattern of three sequential phases that are always repeated in various situations and levels, depending on how dramatic the change is; from a small lifestyle change in our daily routine, to the loss of a loved person, to environmental changes in our surroundings. The first phase of transitioning is the \u2018unfamiliarise\u2019. This is the process of letting go of the norms and values we are attached to. It involves questioning our beliefs and letting go of the old patterns that no longer serve us. This phase can be difficult and often comes with a sense of uncertainty and discomfort. However, it is essential to acknowledge that letting go of the old is necessary for growth and transformation. The second phase of transitioning is \u2018grief\u2019. This phase involves the inevitable distress and suffering from the loss of the familiar. We may experience sadness, fear, and uncertainty during this phase as we confront the reality of what we have lost. However, it is essential to acknowledge that grief is a necessary part of the process of transitioning. It is a natural response to change, and it allows us to process our emotions and come to terms with the new reality. The third phase of transitioning is \u2018rebirth\u2019. In this last part we are now liberated by the past, and new entities start to grow. It is a time of new beginnings, where we can embrace the change and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and direction. This phase can be exhilarating and empowering as we discover new opportunities and possibilities that we could not have imagined before. Transitioning from one phase of life to another is for sure one of the greatest challenges. etting into deeper understanding of the processes that take place - unfamiliarising, grief, and rebirth - can help navigate the process of change. Each phase is necessary for growth and transformation, and only by embracing the process of transitioning, we can allow now qualities emerge and move forward to whatever is coming next. utopias, eutopias and dystopias \u00b6 Fiction is a powerful tool that allows us to envision different possibilities for the future. It seems interesting to analyse the types of imagination that can be used as speculative tools and the roles that each one play. Utopia - the desirable and impossible usually is about an ideal society where everything is perfect. This type of imagination is often used to inspire individuals to work towards a better future. By imagining what could be possible, individuals are motivated to strive for a better world. However, it is important to remember that utopias are not without their flaws. They can be overly idealistic and may not be feasible in reality. Dystopia - the undesirable and possible Dystopian thinking involves envisioning a future where everything has gone wrong and is often used to warn individuals of the potential dangers of certain actions or policies. By imagining the worst-case scenario, people can take steps to prevent it from happening. However, it is important to balance dystopian thinking with the above \u2018positive\u2019 forms of imagination. Overly pessimistic thinking can lead to a sense of hopelessness and may discourage individuals from taking action. Eutopia - the desirable and possible Eutopia describes a better society that is achievable with the right resources and efforts. This type is grounded in reality and takes into account the limitations and challenges of the present. Eutopias can serve as a blueprint for the future and can help guide decision-making. Each type of imagination offers a unique perspective on the future and can be used to explore and eventually create balance in the realities we live in. Utopias inspire us to strive for a better future, eutopias offer practical solutions to current challenges, and dystopias cultivate the sense of danger and fear. the fear of the unknown \u00b6 Taking into account the above categories, we can now illustrate the connection between the transition phases and how we direct our imagination; The unfamiliarising process can trigger the fear of the unknown, which is tightly connected to the fear of death and non-existence. Taking \u2018nature\u2019 as an example, if we acknowledge nature as life that has temporary phases which at some point will be transformed into something else, we might then be able to have a different, more liberated relationship with our surroundings. Through speculative fiction we can and maybe must (re-)imagine morality and temporality in an uncanny ecosystem. Showing the, the catastrophes of our times (\u2018dystopias\u2019) in which we are bodily involved in as playful stories, where light and colours can emerge (\u2018utopias\u2019), eventually will enable re-understanding these moralities and temporalities anew(\u2018eutopias\u2019). Speculative fiction allows for a \u201c\u2026sense of wonder that was terrible \u2013 though not in such a way that it stopped action but brought us into the world more fully instead\u201d (Tsing, 2021). Speculating about human and non-human life forms from a fictional point of view can reveal common grounds and disclose shared values. To understand life as a whole in this way, we must reflect on and re-imagine the meaning, origin, and purpose of current cohabitations. Ultimately, we are \u201ccarrier bags\u201d of meaning that we pass on and that can form possible conceptual displacements. criticism \u00b6 The remaining problem with democratising storytelling is that it is not treated seriously and is dismissed as not real, as pure fiction. It appears that \u201cat that moment, the \u2018real\u2019 expanded and swallowed up whole continents of social imagination marginalising as fantasy whatever was left\u201d (Dunne & Raby, 2013, p.19). But this did not occur by accident. It is the result of our fast-paced societies that especially in the west are becoming more and more intense and absorbing. What is being proposed might fairly be called idealistic, as it suggests a radical twist in these realities that we daily experience. It can be a matter of privilege having the room to unsettle one\u2019s microcosmos and all the comforts it comes along with. Expanding mindsets requires time and accessibility since \u201cwe need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridise, borrow, and embrace the many tools available\u201d (Dunne & Raby, 2013, p.14). Writing history of the planet is not prerogative of writers, artists, or philosophers. In fact, it is not prerogative of the human but instead a fluid collaboration of expertise. Telling the story of life together is \u201cabout meaning and culture, about adding to what life could be [\u2026] it is a catalyst for social dreaming\u201d (Dunne & Raby, 2013, p. 189). The past, the present, and the future appear to us through a multi-dimensional panorama. We all carry a bag. But its bottoms are open, its contents are everywhere. As we see, \u201cthe story isn\u2019t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars\u201c (Le Guin, 1986). The story will never be over and the ways we tell and listen to them should never stay constant. references \u00b6 Anderson, B.

Projecting one\u2019s own experience onto other people, species and entities might lead to a manifestation of justices and injustices, allies and enemies, good and evil. By imagining the future collectively we cannot get completely rid of our blinkers (horse blinders), but combining multiple blinkered visions can create panoramic views.","title":"more-than-me"},{"location":"reflections/term2/making%20sense/making%20sense/#transition-process","text":"The process of transitioning can be interpreted into a pattern of three sequential phases that are always repeated in various situations and levels, depending on how dramatic the change is; from a small lifestyle change in our daily routine, to the loss of a loved person, to environmental changes in our surroundings. The first phase of transitioning is the \u2018unfamiliarise\u2019. This is the process of letting go of the norms and values we are attached to. It involves questioning our beliefs and letting go of the old patterns that no longer serve us. This phase can be difficult and often comes with a sense of uncertainty and discomfort. However, it is essential to acknowledge that letting go of the old is necessary for growth and transformation. The second phase of transitioning is \u2018grief\u2019. This phase involves the inevitable distress and suffering from the loss of the familiar. We may experience sadness, fear, and uncertainty during this phase as we confront the reality of what we have lost. However, it is essential to acknowledge that grief is a necessary part of the process of transitioning. It is a natural response to change, and it allows us to process our emotions and come to terms with the new reality. The third phase of transitioning is \u2018rebirth\u2019. In this last part we are now liberated by the past, and new entities start to grow. It is a time of new beginnings, where we can embrace the change and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and direction. This phase can be exhilarating and empowering as we discover new opportunities and possibilities that we could not have imagined before. Transitioning from one phase of life to another is for sure one of the greatest challenges. etting into deeper understanding of the processes that take place - unfamiliarising, grief, and rebirth - can help navigate the process of change. Each phase is necessary for growth and transformation, and only by embracing the process of transitioning, we can allow now qualities emerge and move forward to whatever is coming next.","title":"transition process"},{"location":"reflections/term2/making%20sense/making%20sense/#utopias-eutopias-and-dystopias","text":"Fiction is a powerful tool that allows us to envision different possibilities for the future. It seems interesting to analyse the types of imagination that can be used as speculative tools and the roles that each one play. Utopia - the desirable and impossible usually is about an ideal society where everything is perfect. This type of imagination is often used to inspire individuals to work towards a better future. By imagining what could be possible, individuals are motivated to strive for a better world. However, it is important to remember that utopias are not without their flaws. They can be overly idealistic and may not be feasible in reality. Dystopia - the undesirable and possible Dystopian thinking involves envisioning a future where everything has gone wrong and is often used to warn individuals of the potential dangers of certain actions or policies. By imagining the worst-case scenario, people can take steps to prevent it from happening. However, it is important to balance dystopian thinking with the above \u2018positive\u2019 forms of imagination. Overly pessimistic thinking can lead to a sense of hopelessness and may discourage individuals from taking action. Eutopia - the desirable and possible Eutopia describes a better society that is achievable with the right resources and efforts. This type is grounded in reality and takes into account the limitations and challenges of the present. Eutopias can serve as a blueprint for the future and can help guide decision-making. Each type of imagination offers a unique perspective on the future and can be used to explore and eventually create balance in the realities we live in. Utopias inspire us to strive for a better future, eutopias offer practical solutions to current challenges, and dystopias cultivate the sense of danger and fear.","title":"utopias, eutopias and dystopias"},{"location":"reflections/term2/making%20sense/making%20sense/#the-fear-of-the-unknown","text":"Taking into account the above categories, we can now illustrate the connection between the transition phases and how we direct our imagination; The unfamiliarising process can trigger the fear of the unknown, which is tightly connected to the fear of death and non-existence. Taking \u2018nature\u2019 as an example, if we acknowledge nature as life that has temporary phases which at some point will be transformed into something else, we might then be able to have a different, more liberated relationship with our surroundings. Through speculative fiction we can and maybe must (re-)imagine morality and temporality in an uncanny ecosystem. Showing the, the catastrophes of our times (\u2018dystopias\u2019) in which we are bodily involved in as playful stories, where light and colours can emerge (\u2018utopias\u2019), eventually will enable re-understanding these moralities and temporalities anew(\u2018eutopias\u2019). Speculative fiction allows for a \u201c\u2026sense of wonder that was terrible \u2013 though not in such a way that it stopped action but brought us into the world more fully instead\u201d (Tsing, 2021). Speculating about human and non-human life forms from a fictional point of view can reveal common grounds and disclose shared values. To understand life as a whole in this way, we must reflect on and re-imagine the meaning, origin, and purpose of current cohabitations. Ultimately, we are \u201ccarrier bags\u201d of meaning that we pass on and that can form possible conceptual displacements.","title":"the fear of the unknown"},{"location":"reflections/term2/making%20sense/making%20sense/#criticism","text":"The remaining problem with democratising storytelling is that it is not treated seriously and is dismissed as not real, as pure fiction.

But this did not occur by accident. It is the result of our fast-paced societies that especially in the west are becoming more and more intense and absorbing. What is being proposed might fairly be called idealistic, as it suggests a radical twist in these realities that we daily experience. It can be a matter of privilege having the room to unsettle one\u2019s microcosmos and all the comforts it comes along with. Expanding mindsets requires time and accessibility since \u201cwe need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridise, borrow, and embrace the many tools available\u201d (Dunne & Raby, 2013, p.14).

And a very old and forgotten memory came back. It was summer, around 2010 on the small Greek island of Aegina with family and friends. My sister\u2019s partner at the time was the kind of social nerd who liked to spread extreme scenarios about the future based on \u201cscientific facts\u201d. Even if he wasn\u2019t a flat-earther, he also enjoyed some conspiracy.. So sometime in the peaceful dusk he wanted to entertain us with the shocking news that he read: \u201cIn a few years we\u2019ll have 3D printing machines that will be able to build anything that we want! The same way we print anything we want on paper, in the future we will be printing real objects\u00b7 people will be freely making all kinds of guns and weapons! It sounded intimidating, but too anarchic to be true.. I knew somehow wasn\u2019t going to happen exactly like that. Coming to today, many (!) years later, I find myself as a lost architect surrounded by technologies made to serve my ambition and will, without knowing what to do with it. However, for the moment I am trying to \u2018do\u2019 more and \u2018think\u2019 less.. Even though I have used a 3d printer before within my studies in architecture, I have only modelled the file (til\u2019 the point of exporting as \u2018.obj\u2019) and then gave it to the technician in charge. This time even though I didn\u2019t have a goal or a reason to use the resources, I had the chance to take over the whole process (at least in theory). So what do I print? I left all the \u2018why\u2019s\u2019 aside and since I didn\u2019t need something for myself, I asked my roommate Korbi what would he need. He said \u2018an iPhone holder for my bike!\u2019. Pretty ambitious and probably not the ideal way to make one but thanks to \u2018thingiverse\u2019, I had access to a whole database with examples, models and recommendations. After doing some research, I chose a nice and simple model which I could adapt to the dimensions of Korbi\u2019s phone and bike. Easier than I thought, we measured the diameter of the handlebar and adjusted the model in rhino. And then, cura\u2019s turn. With Korbi\u2019s help we imported it, put some support where needed (by instinct), set the temperatures and sliced it up. estimated time: 8 hours\u2026 an entire day-shift of work for the poor printer. bueno, it has one job.. So I proudly go to Adai and say \u2018I have it all ready, let\u2019s print\u2019 ! Thankfully he didn\u2019t trust my over-confidence (given the fact I had never done it by myself) so he double-checked the file and obviously the were some teeny tiny mistakes. We fixed them, pressed the button, kiss goodnight and ciao. (ok, not so fast\u00b7 for the first two layers I was there, staring at it and wondering what is it doing.. it does some pretty weird moves in the beginning). The next morning with some extra excitement I go see the result.. tadaan, there it was. all clean and set. Maybe a little too set, it was pretty stuck on the bed and couldn\u2019t let it go. I understand, they spent a whole night together\u2026 With some patience and love I took the pieces and surprisingly easily I cut out the support. now, only thing missing it to try it on the bike.","title":"3d printing"},{"location":"reflections/term2/prototyping/generative%20design/generative%20design/","text":"this challenge seemed like a nice opportunity to give another chance to me and grasshopper. Coming from an architecture school, we had some minimal interaction before but always thought there is potential for us two, with or without the role of an architect. And so it happened. I wanted to model something organic, but with a \u2018technological\u2019 twist. so I found on youtube a tutorial of a tree-like shape, which reminded me of a tornado, a structural column, or a rose flower. The tutorial was quite advanced -for my level- but I really enjoyed re-discovering some of the endless possibilities of grasshopper! the most frustrating part was the plug-ins\u2026 most tutorials that i watched included many components that don\u2019t come together with the grasshopper and it is not mentioned in advance. Even if most of the plug-ins are open source, they are only available for a Windows operating system, which I don\u2019t have. Thankfully though I had easy access to an old windows laptop at home, so I managed to download the \u2018Kangaroo\u2019 and the \u2018lunchbox\u2019 in that one. after some transferring back and forth to different computers, there I had my baked model!

However, I have never used it for other uses than urban, landscape or architectural models. It was very interesting for me to discover the potential of these machines beyond the limitations of this field. Prototyping and physical modelling (maquettes) are two very different approaches: In the first case, the model is nothing more than an interpretive simulation of the \u201creal\u201d project: different scale, different materials, different functions. On the other hand, prototyping has a much more direct relationship with the project. It is the project itself; ok, maybe still quite far from the final goal or original idea, but still, more closely related to its origin. This was for me the first time using the laser cutter in a 1-1 scale\u00b7 first time I didn\u2019t have to convert meters to 1:20 or 1:50 scale when preparing the laser file! Here are two examples of what I got to cut in the machine so far. press-fit \u00b6 during the first microchallenge week, together with my team Amanda and Seher we decided to build quite a complex and ambitious tool that could store data (audio) in objects (cups). For that we had to employ multidisciplinary design tools: ideating & storytelling, electronics and coding, engeneering, digital fabricating. The part that needed to be designed and fabricated from scratch was the turning table, which would spin the cup as a pen carved sound graphs on its outter surface. our only guidance in terms of dimensions was of the aluminum framework and the motors that we borrowed (!) from an old, broken 3D printer. We used the press-fit technique to secure the stability of the structure, therefore we designed the pieces on rhino using our measurments, instincts and a lot of hope. Given the fact that these days were intense and the fab lab was full of stressed students queuing impatiently to cut their drawings, we wouldn\u2019t have the luxury of failing and retrying. thankfully we were very lucky making our first cutting work (ok, with some sanding..) and using them for our final result. It came out neat and definitely strong! workshop cards \u00b6 here we used the laser cutter to make cards for a workshop we organised with Stella.

Another interesting concept I came across is the use of cotton as a conductor . The cotton fibers are covered with microscopic particles enabling them to conduct electricity. The applications of this are endless, but they have already used them to sense the heart rate of a person wearing the fabric, and created clothes that can power electronic devices, or even create color without dyes! @ https://newatlas.com/future-of-cotton/17077/ red cabbage - from the references \u00b6 Most of the red cabbage varieties grown in the United States originated in Germany and the Low Countries. \u201cRed\u201d cabbage (magenta to purplish) was first described in England in 1570, all of the early varieties being round-headed. @ https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/cabbage.html Red cabbage as a vegetable is one of my favorites. As a person who hardly ever cooks, I really appreciate the ease of eating it raw (or cooked) and its relatively high nutrition value. Another fascinating part is its inner shapes. It has an amazing variety of red and purple tones and when being cut in sections, beautiful patterns appear. Depending on the cut (horizontal, vertical, random), it tells a different story . It is essentially a leaf-overlay with various thicknesses on its body. empties - solids, hards - softs. As a human, I can read on it mathematic structures, tree diagrams, neural networks, or free handrawings. Another interesting aspect is that it changes its color according to the pH value of the soil due to a pigment belonging to anthocyanins. In acidic soils, the leaves grow more reddish; in neutral soils, they will grow more purple, while an alkaline soil will produce rather greenish-yellow colored cabbages. This explains the fact that the same plant is known by different colors in various regions. A personally experienced use of red cabbage juice is a pH indicator , as it turns red in acid and green/yellow in basic solutions. Within the \u201cbio & agri zero\u201d seminar of the first term we experimented with the red cabbage and made our diy ph paper! Interestingly, when I picked this material from the list of references presented in class, I didn\u2019t know that the referred material was red cabbage. The image of this translucent membrane with its vein-like patterns attracted me and only after doing some research did I discover that the original material behind it. Apparently, the studio nir meiri processed the cabbage leaves and launched their lighting collection \u201c veggie lights \u201d during london design festival 2019. the lamp collection was made out of thin layers of red cabbage with the materials developed by vaidehi thakkar called \u2018fiber flats\u2019. Its strongly communicative and information-rich surface can be used in art or in wearables, depending on the process it goes through. Besides the material itself, i imagine it being used as a reference to other kinds of creations. hyperskin - an ideal story (in the making) \u00b6 my hyperskin companion has always been with me. i cant remember the first time i saw it, but i have seen it changing and growing with me through time. when im cold, it wraps around me like a blanket. thick, soft and heavy. other times it is rough and rigid, more like an impenetrable shield. when i travel and its warm, it shrinks so much that i can fit it inside my jeans pocket. sometimes i wonder it partly evaporates in the air. it always fits me, somehow it adapts its shape to my needs. when i\u2019m hungry i can also eat a little bit of it, and with some good care it grows back it\u2019s size. is also nourished by my body, my sweat, my breath, my energy. when i get sick it becomes strong and thick, and when it gets weak, it revives from my health. when i die, it remains as a carrier of my spirit to its next host. i don\u2019t know it\u2019s origin but i imagine it travels through non-linear time adapting to each epoque\u2026 to be continued exercise #2: material design \u00b6 Choose one recipe you would like to work on for your project and further develop it (experiment, modify additive,quantities, methodology). You will need to: - Design it (aesthetics/images/sketches) - Research on ingredients (origins & properties) Even though I really enjoy playing with materials and forms hands-on, I have been very skeptical with the \u2018circularity\u2019 of biomaterials and all the supposedly sustainability they promote. However, I did enjoy the \u2018cooking\u2019 part as i don\u2019t practice it very often at home (!). The process of building something from scratch collectively, with a lot of improvisation and then seeing it transformed, becoming a concrete object with its own story, is something I have missed in my journey through the master so far. It becomes clear that -again- the most appealing part for me is the story of the materials. The unknown story behind them and their possible stories ahead. That being said, with my group we tried to approach this exercise with a concept that would provoke wondering, questioning, \u2018shaking the ground\u2019 of our mindsets. We decided to use human and cat hair as a main additive which was admittedly unattractive. Mixing it with gelatine made it even more disgusting, which at the same time made it more interesting. We decided it to weave our story around this paradoxical repulsion towards our body\u2019s drivatives, which apparently are perfectly described by the word \u2018abjects\u2019: objects from our immediate bodies that we reject and interpret as disgusting, dead, as parting from us. eg hair, pee, sweat, blood, etc\u2026 Our aim was to challenge the boundaries between accepted and unaccepted as culturally constructed and serving the maintainance of social order and power dynamics. team: Korbinian, Marielle, Myrto, Stella","title":"remixing materials"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#remixing-materials","text":"track: application","title":"remixing materials"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#exercise-1-material-narratives","text":"choose 1 material around, 1 material from references and one ideal/fictional material and do the following: - properties (functional, technical & emotional) - describe what is it and their aspect/aesthetic (add photo to documentation) - what is the story behind them (who did them, why, where it comes from) - 2 possible applications for each","title":"exercise #1: material narratives"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#cotton-around-me","text":"Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae.

The applications of this are endless, but they have already used them to sense the heart rate of a person wearing the fabric, and created clothes that can power electronic devices, or even create color without dyes! @ https://newatlas.com/future-of-cotton/17077/","title":"cotton - around me"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#red-cabbage-from-the-references","text":"Most of the red cabbage varieties grown in the United States originated in Germany and the Low Countries. \u201cRed\u201d cabbage (magenta to purplish) was first described in England in 1570, all of the early varieties being round-headed. @ https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/cabbage.html Red cabbage as a vegetable is one of my favorites. As a person who hardly ever cooks, I really appreciate the ease of eating it raw (or cooked) and its relatively high nutrition value. Another fascinating part is its inner shapes. It has an amazing variety of red and purple tones and when being cut in sections, beautiful patterns appear. Depending on the cut (horizontal, vertical, random), it tells a different story . It is essentially a leaf-overlay with various thicknesses on its body. empties - solids, hards - softs. As a human, I can read on it mathematic structures, tree diagrams, neural networks, or free handrawings. Another interesting aspect is that it changes its color according to the pH value of the soil due to a pigment belonging to anthocyanins. In acidic soils, the leaves grow more reddish; in neutral soils, they will grow more purple, while an alkaline soil will produce rather greenish-yellow colored cabbages. This explains the fact that the same plant is known by different colors in various regions. A personally experienced use of red cabbage juice is a pH indicator , as it turns red in acid and green/yellow in basic solutions. Within the \u201cbio & agri zero\u201d seminar of the first term we experimented with the red cabbage and made our diy ph paper! Interestingly, when I picked this material from the list of references presented in class, I didn\u2019t know that the referred material was red cabbage. The image of this translucent membrane with its vein-like patterns attracted me and only after doing some research did I discover that the original material behind it. Apparently, the studio nir meiri processed the cabbage leaves and launched their lighting collection \u201c veggie lights \u201d during london design festival 2019. the lamp collection was made out of thin layers of red cabbage with the materials developed by vaidehi thakkar called \u2018fiber flats\u2019. Its strongly communicative and information-rich surface can be used in art or in wearables, depending on the process it goes through. Besides the material itself, i imagine it being used as a reference to other kinds of creations.","title":"red cabbage - from the references"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#hyperskin-an-ideal-story-in-the-making","text":"my hyperskin companion has always been with me. i cant remember the first time i saw it, but i have seen it changing and growing with me through time. when im cold, it wraps around me like a blanket. thick, soft and heavy. other times it is rough and rigid, more like an impenetrable shield. when i travel and its warm, it shrinks so much that i can fit it inside my jeans pocket. sometimes i wonder it partly evaporates in the air. it always fits me, somehow it adapts its shape to my needs. when i\u2019m hungry i can also eat a little bit of it, and with some good care it grows back it\u2019s size. is also nourished by my body, my sweat, my breath, my energy. when i get sick it becomes strong and thick, and when it gets weak, it revives from my health. when i die, it remains as a carrier of my spirit to its next host. i don\u2019t know it\u2019s origin but i imagine it travels through non-linear time adapting to each epoque\u2026 to be continued","title":"hyperskin - an ideal story (in the making)"},{"location":"reflections/term2/remixing%20materials/remixing%20materials/#exercise-2-material-design","text":"Choose one recipe you would like to work on for your project and further develop it (experiment, modify additive,quantities, methodology).

However, I did enjoy the \u2018cooking\u2019 part as i don\u2019t practice it very often at home (!). The process of building something from scratch collectively, with a lot of improvisation and then seeing it transformed, becoming a concrete object with its own story, is something I have missed in my journey through the master so far. It becomes clear that -again- the most appealing part for me is the story of the materials. The unknown story behind them and their possible stories ahead. That being said, with my group we tried to approach this exercise with a concept that would provoke wondering, questioning, \u2018shaking the ground\u2019 of our mindsets. We decided to use human and cat hair as a main additive which was admittedly unattractive. Mixing it with gelatine made it even more disgusting, which at the same time made it more interesting. We decided it to weave our story around this paradoxical repulsion towards our body\u2019s drivatives, which apparently are perfectly described by the word \u2018abjects\u2019: objects from our immediate bodies that we reject and interpret as disgusting, dead, as parting from us. eg hair, pee, sweat, blood, etc\u2026 Our aim was to challenge the boundaries between accepted and unaccepted as culturally constructed and serving the maintainance of social order and power dynamics. team: Korbinian, Marielle, Myrto, Stella","title":"exercise #2: material design"},{"location":"reflections/term3/term3/","text":"","title":"term 3"}]}
