**CNC**: Computer Numerical Control  

in this course we were introduced to the world of CNC, a type of machining that is a pillar of the manufacturing industry, harnessing the power of computer programming to control factory equipment and tool operations.  
the products produced by CNC machines tend to be large-scale and can contribute to an increase in industrial waste. They also usually have minimal fillets. However, on the positive side, these products are often more durable and longer lasting. The CNC machines themselves are robust, with some units weighing in excess of several tons.   

CNC machines offer a range of cutting capabilities and are typically designated for professional applications. they operate along three axes, facilitating both **2D** and **3D** cutting operations, as well as an option for **2.5D** cutting: a technique similar to carving, thus adding versatility to what can be achieved with CNC machining.   

a main advantage of CNC is its **precision**. This technique has great accuracy in comparison to other manufacturing methods. I was intrigued to discover the existence of handheld CNC machines, although their outcome really depends on the user's skills.  

during our exploration, we analysed the individual components of a CNC machine, particularly the lower section, which often features a T slot. This slot plays a crucial role in securing the material.

We delved into the crucial aspect of CNC **safety**, especially when using the collet (see picture below). Due to its high-speed rotation, it's vital to handle it with extreme attention and ensure that the size being used is the correct one for the intended dimension.

**milling types**  
- the **3-axis** milling involves a technique where the cutting tool moves in three different directionsâ€”up and down (Z), left and right (X), and forward and backward (Y). This way, it can remove material from the item it's working on. This can be done with either a milling machine, which is like a big drill, or a turning machine, which spins the item really fast.

- on a more advanced level, there are the **multi-axis** CNC. This milling uses machines that can move in more than four or five different directions, which then allows for even greater detail and complexity in the item that's being created.  
    - there are three main ways this can work:   
    - indexed milling: Here, the cutting tool moves to different fixed positions to make complex shapes.  
    - continuous milling: In this method, the cutting tool follows a constant path, which allows it to make smooth surfaces and intricate outlines.  
    - mill-turning: This is when a single machine can do the job of both a milling and a turning machine. It can make complex shapes all in one go, without needing to set up again!
