"cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank"  

in other words cryptocurrency represents a digital or electronic form of money, secured through cryptographic methods, which are sophisticated coding techniques that safeguard transactions. Unlike traditional currencies regulated by central authorities such as banks or governments, cryptocurrencies operate independently.

These currencies do not have a physical embodiment, they exclusively exist in the digital realm, and their storage occurs in digital wallets. The underlying technology, called blockchain, supports the control of new unit creation and secure fund transfers. This decentralised ledger system records transactions across many computers, thus bypassing conventional banking structures, reinforcing transparency and diminishing the potential for fraud.

### about NFts   
in the domain of blockchain technology, we encounter various categories of tokens: **fungible, semi-fungible, and non-fungible tokens**. Essentially, these tokens are digital manifestations of assets – any form of content or value that exists digitally within blockchain systems.  

tokens can be utilized for a range of applications, including access to services, interaction with decentralized applications, or signifying ownership of certain assets. The distinction among the different types of tokens lies in their characteristics:  

- fungible tokens are interchangeable since every token possesses identical value. For instance, prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum classify as fungible tokens. If you exchange one Bitcoin for another, the value you hold remains consistent.  

- semi-fungible tokens exhibit a blend of fungible and non-fungible characteristics. Each token within this classification can possess unique attributes, making it distinct within a specific set. However, these tokens also share some common traits.  

- non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent unique and indivisible digital assets. Each NFT possesses distinct attributes that set it apart from all other tokens. NFTs can signify ownership of a specific item or entity, ranging from artwork and collectibles to virtual real estate.  

as for the concept of wallets within this context, they function as digital storage systems for assets such as cryptocurrencies or tokens. They enable users to manage and access their digital assets securely.  

### creating NFts  

first, we create a [temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/download?platform=extension), which works like a browser extention.  

then we make an account on IPFS, a free file saver.

then here we have our [tezos profile](https://tzprofiles.com/) 

### NFTs and art  
As we've come to understand, NFTs represent a transformative method for artists to monetize their digital artwork. This artwork can span various mediums, including images, 3D models, music, or even computer code. These NFTs function as a unique digital certification, providing concrete proof of ownership and authenticity for a particular piece of digital art.  
The typical process includes uploading the digital artwork onto an NFT-compatible platform or marketplace. This uploaded artwork then becomes a block of code within a blockchain, defined by a 'smart contract' that establishes the artwork's characteristics, ownership rights, among other details. These blocks of code often fall under the management of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These DAOs consist of members who collectively make decisions regarding the governance and distribution of NFTs.  

a practical application can be seen on platforms like [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/), a marketplace operating on the Tezos blockchain. Here, an artist might upload a piece of editable code, allowing the first 200 users to download, modify some variables, and 'mint' it. Once minted, the code becomes immutable, transforming it into a sellable Non-Fungible Token.
