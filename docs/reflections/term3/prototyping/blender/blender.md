During the first session Victor introduced us to Blender, a versatile design tool with a vibrant community. We learned that Blender is not only used for animation but also has other useful functions like CAD and rendering. It can connect seamlessly with different devices and interfaces. While some tools promise quick and easy solutions, they often prevent a more intuitive way of creating, making it hard to invest time in learning them. We tend to prefer simple tools because we want fast results and personal validation.

In the second session, we started using Blender and learned basic functions like moving models in space and creating arrays.

Victor showed us how to use Blender's coding interface to control the program instead of relying on basic tools. This is an advantage of Blender compared to other CAD and rendering programsâ€”it offers multiple ways to interact with it. We also learned how to connect Arduino to Blender. By modeling a switch in Blender, we could control a light connected to Arduino. I had some difficulties with Arduino IDE and its libraries, so I couldn't complete the task as planned. Nevertheless, it was still enjoyable to discover more about Blender.
