THESIS The milestone of my past academic experience is my thesis project called \u201cPlastic Age\u201d which was developed with my colleague Maria.

By seeing plastic as a \u201chyperobject\u201d, we created a plastic city, built by its own waste products. A new layer of plastic covered the ancient city and gradually started spreading around the world. In this entirely artificial era, nature as we know it is nothing but an ancestral monument. By playfully flirting between dystopic and utopic approach, we tried to discover new qualities within this supposedly tragic scenario. Coming to today, while configuring my current fight and its multiple dimensions, I came across to the concept of filter bubbles.

Article \u00b6 \u201cSex of Researcher Influences Ketamine\u2019s Effects in Mice\u201d \u201cAs New Scientist reports, the researchers got different results when testing the antidepressant effects of ketamine in mice depending on which members of the lab conducted the experiment, which involved measuring how long the mice would swim when placed in a tank. Gould, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, had read a 2014 study that found the presence of men, but not women, dulls mice\u2019s pain, and according to a university news release, his team also heard anecdotes from other labs about experimental results that seemed to be influenced by researcher sex. So they decided to test whether this could explain the inconsistencies they saw, since they couldn\u2019t replicate their experiments. The team reported in an August 30 Nature Neuroscience paper that the sex of researchers working with mice did indeed influence outcomes involving ketamine treatment, with the scent of human males triggering the release of a hormone in mice\u2019s brains that enabled the drug to work as an antidepressant. The findings suggest that researcher sex may confound animal research in a variety of experiments . \u201cOur findings in mice suggests that activating a specific stress circuit in the brain may be a way to improve ketamine treatment\u201d Gould says in the university announcement. The researchers also delved into the mechanisms behind that effect, and found that when men administered ketamine to the mice, a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was released in an area of the mouse hippocampus associated with depression, enabling the ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effect. This didn\u2019t happen when women administered the drug unless they accompanied the ketamine with a dose of CRF. Gerlinde Metz of the University of Lethbridge in Canada tells New Scientist that researcher sex is just one of many variables that can affect animal experiments; others include their shipment to the lab, diet, and even the season. She says researchers should try to control for the effects of these variables as best they can, although it may be impossible to do so completely.\u201d https://www.newscientist.com/article/2337160-the-sex-of-the-researcher-can-influence-results-of-mouse-experiments/ https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/sex-of-researcher-influences-ketamine-s-effects-in-mice-study-70468 Article reflection \u00b6 When I read the title of this article, at first it caught my attention because of the statement. The human\u2019s gender role in mice experiments sounds definitely an unexpected and interesting observation, so as the possible benefits to the medicine\u2019s effect in humans. But this was not the reason I chose this article for the assignment. From the very first until the last day of the course Nuria was strongly stressing out the importance of keeping track of the experiment\u2019s conditions, like any slight modification we make in our recipes and keeping track of every single variable that can possibly affect the results. Truth is, it has been almost impossible for us not to make any mistake or improvising a little. But at least in our case we could still be aware of it. So when I read that such an unexpected, supposedly irrelevant factor like the gender can affect the experiment\u2019s results, I really understood how complex it can get. The scientists couldn\u2019t replicate the experiment even in such an advanced and professional level. I realized that even when we think we control all of the parameters and be extremely precise, there can always be a surprise. There is going to be a tiny detail that we miss and might have a dramatic influence. I find this process very frustrating, demanding and fascinating . I am hoping to experience those multi coloured feelings of discovery within my MDEF journey.

Nevertheless, at the 3 rd year of my studies I participated in an extracurricular workshop for the design and manufacture of wooden benches in the exterior of the university. During the manufacturing process we tested the materials, the dimensions and proportions of the wooden planks, the amount and place of screws and other practical details. We were able to get instant feedback from the people passing by and test its durability before the final assembly. Another experience of working with the 1 st role was within the course \u201cNARRATIVE TRAILS: Designing [for] the Pelion hiking trails\u201d. The course was about mapping of a thematic route and design and construct an outdoor small-scale intervention. Our intervention turned out to be a game assembled by hands with all its pieces made out of cardboard. Along the process we tested multiple different sizes and versions of the game (board, floor, wearable) with the help of our class. We ended up \u2018wrapping\u2019 the game around tree trunks: it consisted of cards with figures designed by a local artist and the goal was to place the cards in the right positions according to the hints. The passengers could play while taking a break from their hike and at the same time get useful information about the culture of the trail. http://www.arch.uth.gr/en/studies/course/1811/8 Role 2 \u00b6 For my thesis project I used the role 2 of prototyping in order to collect more information about the city. The biggest part of the project was research, as we were dealing with much complex areas (archaeology, cement factory, forest department and more). Not knowing yet what was the purpose of the project or what it was going to look like, we created a questionnaire in order to collect more data. We knew the issues that we wanted to address, but not the actual purpose of our design so we wanted to know the public\u2019s views on the matter. Our topic was the environmental crisis, so we took advantage of a public demonstration happening on a specific day and went in the streets with 200 printed questionnaires, asking people to participate. The project took a radical turn which was indirectly related to the outcomes of that day. Another experience of working with the 2 nd role was within the course \u201cStructural [Trans]-Formations\u201d. The course objective was to explore the structural concept of a \u2018lightweight\u2019 structure that will host a performance event. The course attempted to approach the structural concept as a design resource and investigate the physical model as a tool for diagrammatic reasoning. The study was systematically recorded in the form of a digital diary (blog) in order to demonstrate alternatives and justify final choices. http://www.arch.uth.gr/en/studies/course/1774/7 Role 3 \u00b6 Due to my background I have worked in several physical and digital models, which would match the role 3 of prototyping, the research archetype. From the first to the last year of my studies and my professional experience I got involved in multiple types of modelling: _ working models; made out of inferior materials (foam, paper, cardboard) and simple tools (cutter, scissors, pencils) which mainly served the purpose of shaping the volume. _ concept / interpretative models; made out of all kinds of materials and colours (from glitter to coffee beans) which were used as mediums to communicate the concept / story / idea. _ final models; carefully made with high quality materials (plexiglass, balsa, grass, puppets) and tools (laser cutter, 3d printers,..). In the 5 th year of studies, within the Design Studio \u201cCity of Rooms\u201d we curated an exhibition in a public gallery presenting the projects of the students. The exhibits were multikind (drawings, models, concepts, videos) and later became objects of discussion among the visitors: professors, students, student\u2019s families and all the public participated in the discussion. As the exhibition took place in the middle of the semester, we then had the chance to use the feedback in to further developing our designs. https://www.archisearch.gr/press/exhibition-volos-city-of-rooms/ Role 4 \u00b6 Finally, my experience in the 4 th role is yet to come. I am very intrigued by the idea of using the prototyping process as a means to generate knowledge, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to use it before. Given the fact that I am interested in collective/embodied design experiences, the idea of a participatory workshop or action that could enlighten the design sounds alluring. Without a doubt the city of Barcelona can offer endless opportunities for such experiments so I am looking forward to use them with the MDEF group and other unexpected participants.","title":"The roles of prototyping"},{"location":"term1/design%20studio/prototyping%20roles/the%20roles%20of%20prototyping/#comparative-overview","text":"Taking a look back to my experience in design, I recall using some of the above roles of prototyping mostly during my studies in architecture.

The wearable mask will be tied around and covering my face. It consists of a base made out of plastic bottle covered in a layer of aluminium foil which will be transforming. It works as an extension of the face, like a piece of clothing. It can adapt its surface depending on the situation. What does it notice? It notices my personal needs when interacting with people and transforms the material, the face expressions or any kind of message I want to communicate to the surroundings through its outer layer. What were you thinking? My wishful superpower has always been the ability to disappear and become temporarily invisible. To some extent it is related to my need for control over my appearance, my body, myself. The face is like a screen which projects personal information even in unwanted situations. At the same time, the pure characteristics of the face regardless of the expression can cause prejudiced and biased reactions. My aim was to somehow protect - address - test the above situations on a personal and on a social level. Why does it matter? The \u2018mask\u2019 is a very primitive yet contemporary object with a great history in multiple fields: It can be used an object for performing arts, rituals, punishment, disguise, fashion, hygiene etc. This particular idea of mask attempts to become an integral part of the self in daily life which will open new communication channels with the environment and bring comfort in uncomfortable situations. Companion reflection \u00b6 After wearing the mask and moving around the city for a day, I noticed the following contradictions : - comfort in hiding vs discomfort in breathing - liberating expression vs limiting communication - sense of protection vs opportunity for exposure - attention avoidance (eg random unwanted acquaintances) vs attention catcher (it looks quite creepy) 24h challenge \u00b6 Exercise brief: - How can you take action on your topic in a brave way? - Can you make some small piece of your idea and live with it? - How can you probe the design space through an embodied / first-person exploration? - Can you create a situation that might reveal something new? TIME-ZERO \u00b6 According to the task timeframe, we were given one and a half day to complete the exercise, meaning to come up with an idea, start applying it, document it and present it in a 1-minute video. Everything had to be done very quickly, which for me and my personal rhythm was just unimaginable. The topics of my interest (for the moment) are quite abstract, vague and seemingly unrelated to each other. So in order to come up with a concept directly related to my topics and matching the assignment requirements, I needed at least one week. And then another week to plan the application of the idea, and then one more to prepare the video. Obviously this was not even close to possible. Therefore I started thinking in a \u2018reversed\u2019 way: \u2022 What if my biggest struggle on the assignment (and in life) becomes the idea I have been looking for? \u2022 What happens if I act instead of think? \u2022 What would my day look like if I have zero time to think? \u2022 How would I react to my stimuli without any sort of processing? \u2022 Is it possible to forcefully interrupt the thinking process (at least the conscious one) and how can I do it? The moment this idea came to my mind, I immediately started applying it. At the same time, my classmates started asking for help in their own projects. I gave myself 2-3 seconds to decide and reply, which led me to a very intense, uncontrolled and versatile day. I got dressed in 5 seconds to go for padel (I wore my pyjama top). Then I went to the beach where I helped in shooting some videos for other projects. When we finished the shooting I went to Elisava for a quick meeting with Oscar (couldn\u2019t have been long since it would interrupt my no-thinking process). On that moment I realised I hadn\u2019t thought of charging my phone, so my documentation capabilities were also limited. While unceasingly applying this challenge during my day, I also came up with 3 mini-challenges within the main one: \u2022 10-minute weekly groceries \u2022 20-minute nonstop writing \u2022 no recipe fast baking (zero cooking / baking knowledge) At the end of the day I was physically and mentally exhausted. TIME-ZERO challenge by Myrto-Eirini Pappa Challenge reflection \u00b6 What did you make? And why did it matter? Taking time to think and process before acting has always been my comfort zone . What I did was an experiment to force myself out of it, to expose my instinctive, unprocessed thoughts and actions. Living in fast-pace and losing control over my life is a great fear and a risk I wouldn\u2019t have taken easily. What happens when you involve yourself? I always thought that my projects were somehow self-involving, because I have always been truthful to what I want to represent. Nevertheless, I realise that I have always been keeping a certain distance from involving my inner self with the fear of getting too self-inclusive. After having performed my first experiment with a deeper self-involvement I value the process differently: there are no longer strong distinctions between the \u2018work\u2019, the \u2018personal life\u2019, the \u2018hobbies\u2019, the \u2018free time\u2019 etc. Everything blends and overlaps with one another, creating a whole interconnected mass. And this feels way more human . What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? When the source of knowledge is your own body, the result is more powerful and long-lasting. It somehow changes a part of your being, and consequently your design practice. The outcome is an authentic, genuine , undeniable point of view which can not be predetermined. Nevertheless there are always two sides: I got passionate and excited but also more frustrated. I was not able to switch to another subject or just take a break since I was the designer and I was the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. Did anything change about your way of working? (still writing) The way \u0399 worked that day was the complete opposite of what I\u2019m used to. I tried to switch from being extremely slow and indecisive, to being extremely fast and direct. What I realised was that \u2018time\u2019 is a luxury which can either reinforce or prevent the project\u2019s development. Having plenty of time can be helpful in building confidence and deeper understanding on the work, but at the same time it might be confusing: Analysing every possibility leads to information overload and procrastination, which misguides and disconnects the project from the original penchant. From my experience, both \u2018extremes\u2019 come with their own set of implications. My goal is to find the right balance between the two and be able to switch modes according to my needs.
