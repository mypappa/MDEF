## material narratives exercise   
`choose 1 material around, 1 material from references and one ideal/fictional material and do the following:  
- properties (functional, technical & emotional)  
- describe what is it and their aspect/aesthetic (add photo to documentation)  
- what is the story behind them (who did them, why, where it comes from)  
- 2 possible applications for each`   

### **cotton** - one material around me

Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.  

It comes from a plant native to tropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.

The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable, and durable textile.
it is mainly used for textile products like underwear, socks and t-shirts, but also in fishnets, coffee filters, tents, book binding and archival paper.   

@ The Biology of Gossypium hirsutum L. and Gossypium barbadense L. (cotton).  

for me cotton is intimacy, closeness, security. it is a memory of home and childhood, when I was 'being-taken-care-of'. As a person from a family with sensitive skin multiple skin intolerances, I was always being told that 100% cotton is the only safe choice when it comes to textiles. I haven't inherited the cotton-mania to this extent but I definitely have some sort of attatchment to cotton.  

There are already multiple applications of cotton as mentioned above. My future speculation would be that is becomes **part of our nutrition**, as its seed is protein-rich. Currently it cannot be digested by humans or animals other than cows but I can easily imagine this changing over the coming years with some scientific help..  
Another interesting concept I came across is the use of cotton as a **conductor**.  
*The cotton fibers are covered with microscopic particles enabling them to conduct electricity. The applications of this are endless, but they have already used them to sense the heart rate of a person wearing the fabric, and created clothes that can power electronic devices, or even create color without dyes!*

### **cabbage** - one material from the references

Cabbage as a vegetable is one of my favorites. As a person who hardly ever cooks, I really appreciate the ease of eating it and its relatively high nutrition values. 
studio [nir meiri](https://www.nirmeiri.com/) launched their new lighting collection, **veggie lights** during london design festival 2019. the lamp collection, made out of thin layers of red cabbage with the materials developed by vaidehi thakkar called ‘fiber flats’.  

### **magicium** - my ideal material   
it is thick, soft and heavy. but it can shrink or evaporate according
