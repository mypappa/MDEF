making an MDEF whatsapp..   

In our Networking class with Victor, we learned how to create networks using the Arduino software and a local server. Working in teams, we attempted to connect to Victor's computer through the local server and the Arduino software interface, with a particular focus on the serial monitor.

To establish a connection to Victor's computer, we had to modify certain sections of the code on the Arduino. First, we downloaded the PunSubClient library and updated the code by changing the WiFi name and password to match our local network. We also had to adjust the mqttClientuser to match Victor's credentials, as well as the topicToSub and mqttClientName to reflect our team's name. Additionally, Korbi made some alterations to the code, but unfortunately, I could not follow that part..  

Unfortunately we were not really successful in sending customised messages but overall it was a relatively fun and constructive class, like all hands-on classes with Victor.
