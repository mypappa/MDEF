*Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.*  

it is mainly used for textile products like underwear, socks and t-shirts, but also in fishnets, coffee filters, tents, book binding and archival paper.  

for me cotton is intimacy, closeness, security. it is a memory of home, childhood, the being-taken-care-of feeling.    

### **cabbage** - one material from the references
