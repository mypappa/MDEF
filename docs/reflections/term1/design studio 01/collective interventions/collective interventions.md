## know thy non-human neighbors  
For our first attempt to explore an aquatic ecosystem in the urban context, we visited the Besòs river: a river flowing through Barcelona formed by the confluence of the Mogent and Congost rivers and ends in the Mediterranean.  
Not knowing specifically what we were looking for, we walked barefoot around the site, trying understand the dynamics, the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters that live in the area and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage: bones, feathers, droppings and other unspecified objects...  
we felt that the area was downgraded and unwelcoming for neither humans nor nun-humans. Interestingly, we were told that its pollution and degradation dates back to the 1960s, mostly due to abandonment and industrialization of the surrounding areas. In 1995 an environmental recovery of the river was initiated, which resulted with the Parque Fluvial del Besò in 2004: a long public green area with space to walk, cycle and practice outdoor sports.

## augmented creativity  
First question that came up on the table was: what is augmentation?  
Obviously there are many different definitions online about the augmented reality (AR) and the virtual reality (VR), but we were more interested in exploring the concept of augmentation in a wider spectrum. We realised that each one had a slightly different idea of what it meant. Personally I perceive augmentation as a distortion or an enhancement of existing information. It can be by adding a new layer of information on the physical ennvironment, but also by removing information and changing the balance of our sensorium. A psychedelic experience, a dream, a video game, they can all be augmented experiences. Dreaming can actually be a 'built-in' augmented reality.
