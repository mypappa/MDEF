At the beginning of this lesson we were asked *What was the first time you heard about 3D printing?*  
And a very old and forgotten memory came back. It was summer, around 2010 on the small Greek island of Aegina with family and friends. My sister's partner at the time was the kind of social nerd who liked to spread extreme scenarios about the future based on "scientific facts". Even if he wasn't a flat-earther, he also enjoyed some conspiracy.. So sometime in the peaceful dusk he wanted to entertain us with the shocking news that he read: 
“In a few years we'll have 3D printing machines that will be able to build anything that we want! The same way we print anything we want on paper, in the future we will be printing real objects· people will be freely making all kinds of guns and weapons! It sounded intimidating, but too anarchic to be true.. I knew somehow wasn't going to happen exactly like that. 

Coming to today, many (!) years later, I find myself being a lost architect surrounded by technologies made to serve my ambition and will, not knowing what to do with it. However, for the moment I am trying to ‘do’ more and ‘think’ less..
Even though I have used 3d printers before within my studies in architecture, I only modelled the file (as far as exporting an ‘obj’ file from rhino) and then just gave it to the technician in charge to print it for me. This time even though I didn’t have a goal or a reason to use these resources, I had the chance to ‘take over’ the whole process (at least in theory).  

So what do I print? I left all the ‘why’s’ aside and since I didn’t need something for myself, I asked my friend and roommate Korbi what would he need. He said ‘an iPhone holder for my bike!’. Pretty ambitious and probably not the ideal way to make it but thanks to ‘thingiverse’, I had access to a whole database with examples, models and recommendations. After doing some research I chose a nice and simple model which I would adapt to the dimensions of Korbi’s phone and bike. Easier than I thought, we measured the diameter of the handlebar and adjusted the model in rhino. And then, cura’s turn. With Korbi’s help we imported it, put some support where needed (by instinct), set the temperatures and sliced it up. estimated time: 8 hours… an entire day-shift of work for the poor printer. bueno, it has one job..

So I proudly go to Adai and say ‘I have it all ready, let’s print’ !
Thankfully he didn’t trust my over-confidence (given the fact I had never done it by myself) so he double-checked the file and obviously the were some tiny mistakeies. We fixed them, pressed the button, kiss goodnight and ciao. (ok not so fast, for the first two layers I was there, staring and wondering what is happening -it does some weird moves in the beginning).

The next morning with some extra excitement I go see the result.. tadaan, there it was. all clean and set. Maybe a little too set, it was pretty stuck on the bed and couldn’t let it go. I understand, they spent a whole night together… 
With some patience and love I took the pieces and surprisingly easily I cut out the support.

now, only thing missing it to try it on the bike.
