## know thy non-human neighbors  
For our first attempt to explore an aquatic ecosystem in the urban context, we visited the Besòs river: a river flowing through Barcelona formed by the confluence of the Mogent and Congost rivers and ends in the Mediterranean.  
Not knowing specifically what we were looking for, we walked barefoot around the site, trying understand the dynamics, the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters that live in the area and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage: bones, feathers, droppings and other unspecified objects...  
we felt that the area was downgraded and unwelcoming for neither humans nor nun-humans. Interestingly, we were told that its pollution and degradation dates back to the 1960s, mostly due to abandonment and industrialization of the surrounding areas. In 1995 an environmental recovery of the river was initiated, which resulted with the Parque Fluvial del Besò in 2004: a long public green area with space to walk, cycle and practice outdoor sports.

## augmented creativity   
### what is augmentation?
First question that came up was what is augmentation?  
There are of course many different definitions online, mostly under the term 'augmented reality (AR)' along with 'virtual reality (VR)', but we were more interested in exploring the concept of augmentation in a wider spectrum. We realised that each one in the group had a slightly different idea of what it meant. Personally I perceive augmentation as a distortion or enhancement of existing information: it can be achieved by adding a extra layer of information onto the physical ennvironment, or by removing part of the information and changing the balance of our sensorium. A psychedelic trip, a dream, a video game, or an isolated audio can be all be augmented experiences. Dreaming might actually be a 'built-in' augmented representation of reality.

### mocap room experiment  
By this experiment we tried to create a non-human experience.+++
