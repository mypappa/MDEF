## fight #1
Starting with the master program, my readings and interests were in creating alternative narratives through storytelling about the romanticised idea of nature, the ancestor worship and post-humanism. Topics that were the core manifestations of my architecture thesis project.   
Not knowing what my first fight should / would be about, I tried to demonstrate through the poster the confusion I felt living in this complex, interconnected environment in a more generalised way. I was concerned about the paradoxes and misconceptions of the contemporary ecological approach: our relationship with the waste we produce, the food we consider ethical and not, the deification / apotheosis of nature. It was an expression of opposition with a dose of irony.

## transitioning
However, I was seeking for new interests, new areas to explore during the first term as it seemed like the perfect, unique opportunity for me to do so. Soon I came across other types intelligences in nonhuman species (spider web -> extended intelligence, Portuguese man of war -> collective intelligence), altered states of consciousness, embodied cognition and psychedelic therapy.  
I followed those interests by experimenting with several activities such as ecstatic dance, hermetic spirituality lectures, yoga practices, the “brains” exhibition at the CCCB, my time-zero 24h challenge at the ’living with your own ideas’ seminar. Alongside I read articles, listened to podcasts, contacted people. While investigating the altered states I connected with a death coach: a person who prepares people for dying. Her work inspired the following idea: becoming more familiar with the uncertainty of our reality can liberate the way we live in  the present (i.e. nature).  

Somewhere along the way I discovered I shared some ideas and interests with my classmate Stella, so we began to timidly join our paths. We developed together a more extensive research about post-nature and speculative fiction through storytelling that enriched our list of references. We explored theories such as the mesh (Timothy Morton), anthropocene - capitalocene - cthulhucene (@Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing Lowenhaupt, Bruno Latour), feralisation (Anna Tsing Lowenhaupt), carrier bags (@Donna Haraway), the Gaia-theory (@James Lovelock) and more.  
With our ever-growing theoretical framework, we created a new design space which we then tried to apply by translating them into questions for the public. In the design dialogues week we created a mesh-type installation with our questions and a QR code leading to the platform of our [open dialogue](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/fLhhX-gQcpsCZCb0Ckj3).  

Other application methods we are currently working on:
- cartographies: a mapping technique to practice in case-studies
- conferences: we are taking part in the Esbrina Research Group conference [“Imaginar mundos posibles](https://esbrina.eu/en/portfolio/imaginar-mundos-posibles-potencialidades-limites-y-fricciones-de-la-ficcion-especulativa-en-la-investigacion-y-la-educacion-3/): Potencialidades, límites y fricciones de la ficción especulativa en la investigación y la educación”, which has inspired us the idea of organising our own conference in Barcelona.   

For the rest, more is coming..
