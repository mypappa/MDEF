Instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena Role 3 : The prototype as a research archetype e.g. showroom, exhibition, interactive process that gives information about the development Role 4 : The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry Prototyping as a research method e.g. participatory workshop Taking a look back to my experience in design, I recall using some of the above roles of prototyping mostly during my studies in architecture. I was not used to the term \u2018prototyping\u2019 but while processing the meaning its potential roles, I have several experiences that match the categories. The role 1 , which is maybe the most self-referential role, has not been one of my main practice tools since the projects I worked were usually in a non-prototypable scale. Nevertheless, at the 3 rd year of my studies I participated in an extracurricular workshop for the design and manufacture of wooden benches in the exterior of the university. During the manufacturing process we tested the materials, the dimensions and proportions of the wooden planks, the amount and place of screws and other practical details. We were able to get instant feedback from the people passing by and test its durability before the final assembly. Another experience of working with the 1 st role was within the course \u201cNARRATIVE TRAILS: Designing [for] the Pelion hiking trails\u201d. The course was about mapping of a thematic route and design and construct an outdoor small-scale intervention. Our intervention turned out to be a game assembled by hands with all its pieces made out of cardboard. Along the process we tested multiple different sizes and versions of the game (board, floor, wearable) with the help of our class. We ended up \u2018wrapping\u2019 the game around tree trunks: it consisted of cards with figures designed by a local artist and the goal was to place the cards in the right positions according to the hints. The passengers could play while taking a break from their hike and at the same time get useful information about the culture of the trail. http://www.arch.uth.gr/en/studies/course/1811/8 For my thesis project I used the role 2 of prototyping in order to collect more information about the city. The biggest part of the project was research, as we were dealing with much complex areas (archaeology, cement factory, forest department and more). Not knowing yet what was the purpose of the project or what it was going to look like, we created a questionnaire in order to collect more data. We knew the issues that we wanted to address, but not the actual purpose of our design so we wanted to know the public\u2019s views on the matter. Our topic was the environmental crisis, so we took advantage of a public demonstration happening on a specific day and went in the streets with 200 printed questionnaires, asking people to participate. The project took a radical turn which was indirectly related to the outcomes of that day. Another experience of working with the 2 nd role was within the course \u201cStructural [Trans]-Formations\u201d. The course objective was to explore the structural concept of a \u2018lightweight\u2019 structure that will host a performance event. The course attempted to approach the structural concept as a design resource and investigate the physical model as a tool for diagrammatic reasoning. The study was systematically recorded in the form of a digital diary (blog) in order to demonstrate alternatives and justify final choices. http://www.arch.uth.gr/en/studies/course/1774/7 Due to my background I have worked in several physical and digital models, which would match the role 3 of prototyping, the research archetype. From the first to the last year of my studies and my professional experience I got involved in multiple types of modelling: _ working models; made out of inferior materials (foam, paper, cardboard) and simple tools (cutter, scissors, pencils) which mainly served the purpose of shaping the volume. _ concept / interpretative models; made out of all kinds of materials and colours (from glitter to coffee beans) which were used as mediums to communicate the concept / story / idea. _ final models; carefully made with high quality materials (plexiglass, balsa, grass, puppets) and tools (laser cutter, 3d printers,..). In the 5 th year of studies, within the Design Studio \u201cCity of Rooms\u201d we curated an exhibition in a public gallery presenting the projects of the students. The exhibits were multikind (drawings, models, concepts, videos) and later became objects of discussion among the visitors: professors, students, student\u2019s families and all the public participated in the discussion. As the exhibition took place in the middle of the semester, we then had the chance to use the feedback in to further developing our designs. https://www.archisearch.gr/press/exhibition-volos-city-of-rooms/ Finally, my experience in the 4 th role is yet to come. I am very intrigued by the idea of using the prototyping process as a means to generate knowledge, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to use it before. Given the fact that I am interested in collective/embodied design experiences, the idea of a participatory workshop or action that could enlighten the design sounds alluring. Without a doubt the city of Barcelona can offer endless opportunities for such experiments so I am looking forward to use them with the MDEF group and other unexpected participants.","title":"The roles of prototyping"},{"location":"Design%20Studio/workspace/my%20workspace/","text":"mapping my augmented workspace \u00b6","title":"My workspace"},{"location":"Design%20Studio/workspace/my%20workspace/#mapping-my-augmented-workspace","text":"","title":"mapping my augmented workspace"},{"location":"Reflexions/term1/aows/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 BOARD TIMELINE \u00b6 The board is not here due to website troubleshooting. Soon to be fixed Starting from my architectural background, I was introduced from the early years of my studies to the process of creative thinking, to building strong concepts and ideas with a more pragmatic and technical aspect. I always used storytelling as a medium to develop a new project that addresses the mega-phenomena around us. Coming from a semi-technical school, I also discovered the power of technology and its fascinating physical and digital outcomes. THESIS The milestone of my past academic experience is my thesis project called \u201cPlastic Age\u201d which was developed with my colleague Maria. The project triggers the ecological crisis we are experiencing and the ways humans are trying to control it. In essence, the project is a alternative narrative about the plastic accumulation on the planet, that questions and redefines the notion of nature. By seeing plastic as a \u201chyperobject\u201d, we created a plastic city, built by its own waste products. A new layer of plastic covered the ancient city and gradually started spreading around the world. In this entirely artificial era, nature as we know it is nothing but an ancestral monument. By playfully flirting between dystopic and utopic approach, we tried to discover new qualities within this supposedly tragic scenario. Coming to today, while configuring my current fight and its multiple dimensions, I came across to the concept of filter bubbles. Having already a background in questioning the \u201ccommon truths\u201d about the environment, I projected this point of view generally on the ideological isolations we live in. The AoWS card game gave me a storm of new interesting topics, some more relevant to my previous approach, some less. Cards like \u201cDismantling filter bubbles\u201d, \u201cTruth Wars\u201d, \u201cFight Anthropocene conflicts\u201d and \u201cAncestral Futures\u201d immediately caught my eye and selected them as the base of my story. (At this point I felt stuck in over-observing and critically evaluating ideas, trying to find meaning, instead of focusing in finding new inputs). While trying to collect the full spectrum of my interests for my board, I tried to retrieve information from my deeper personal self, which I never dared to explore or include in my projects / experiments. I have had the quote \u201cSubconscious is God\u201d in my mind the last months from a book that I read and wrote that too, without any idea of its relevance or potential use. After the presentation of Mariana, I suddenly realized that there might actually be potential. Along with AI and machine learning, a new area of opportunities opened up for me. I Realized that it somehow connects with my initial fight about the illusionary world and the filter bubbles I selected from the atlas. It\u2019s about getting closer to knowing and understanding. Many new questions were raised: How can we bring ourselves closer to our subconscious and the richness of information that is there encrypted? How is the cognitive gap between the areas of our brain related to the humanitarian conflicts? How could instinctive negative or aggressive emotions be dismantled ? How can technology help to all that? I might be getting into deep waters with no background whatsoever and I don\u2019t know where this will take me, but I know I am curious and excited to explore it as much as I can.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"Reflexions/term1/aows/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"Reflexions/term1/aows/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#board-timeline","text":"The board is not here due to website troubleshooting.
