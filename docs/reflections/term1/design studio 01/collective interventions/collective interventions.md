## know thy non-human neighbors  
For our first attempt to explore an aquatic ecosystem in the urban context, we visited the Besòs river: a river flowing through Barcelona formed by the confluence of the Mogent and Congost rivers and ends in the Mediterranean.  
Not knowing specifically what we were looking for, we walked barefoot around the site, trying understand the dynamics, the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters that live in the area and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage: bones, feathers, droppings and other unspecified objects...  
we felt that the area was downgraded and unwelcoming for neither humans nor nun-humans. Interestingly, we were told that its pollution and degradation dates back to the 1960s, mostly due to abandonment and industrialization of the surrounding areas. In 1995 an environmental recovery of the river was initiated, which resulted with the Parque Fluvial del Besò in 2004: a long public green area with space to walk, cycle and practice outdoor sports.

## augmented creativity   
### what is augmentation?
First question that came up was what is augmentation?  
There are of course many different definitions online, mostly under the term 'augmented reality (AR)' along with 'virtual reality (VR)', but we were more interested in exploring the concept of augmentation in a wider spectrum. We realised that each one in the group had a slightly different idea of what it meant. Personally I perceive augmentation as a distortion or enhancement of existing information: it can be achieved by adding a extra layer of information onto the physical ennvironment, or by removing part of the information and changing the balance of our sensorium. A psychedelic trip, a dream, a video game, or an isolated audio can be all be augmented experiences. Dreaming might actually be a 'built-in' augmented representation of reality.

### mocap room experiment

This experiment was part of our research of the possibility to extend human perspectives to more-than-human ontologies. Until now they made use of sensory systems to create methodologies that help to establish empathy with otherness. The aim was to bring participants into a context from which collaborative practices can integrate the more-than-human and allows to open up space for unheard voices.

For our intervention we used water as an example of other entity. We collected words that somehow describe the different forms of water and with them we created short 'poems' about the transitions of the water between solid, liquid and gas. For that we used the *haiku* Japanese poetic form that consists of three lines, with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern.

We followed an explorative approach: we experimented with long practiced techniques of herbal-tea, breath work, and video projection. Our facilitator, Paige, read the poems to the participants and they moved freely inside the room. These movements were captured with motion-capture-technologies as tried to translate between virtual and physical. 

it will be interesting to see how our feedback-systems will lead to further evolution in the coming time.
