reframing / reflecting on my project

`Goals: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals and next steps.`  

- abstract ideas are not easy to materialise   
My thoughts have been quite vague and abstract during the first term. This opened many new pathways of collaboration with different people and exploring multiple fields. However, when the time came to translate these ideas onto the real world and practice experiments, things were challenging. It felt like any idea put into practice costed some loss in the meaning of it, or takes to other, non intended paths. For instance, the 'augmented creativity' group was formed with the goal of exploring *altered states of consciousness* and creating non-human experiences. Our intervention at the mocap room turned out to be more of a spiritual activity, which was not part of our initial plan. Even though abstract concepts cannot be easily solidified, I found value in applying fast-paced tests, even if they do not seem to perfectly fit all the objectives.  

- simple and effective creations hide a mess  
This has been part of my design experience already but it is always a surprise to see it happening like a loop.
For the design dialogues we had this idea of building a mesh of wires/fibers and then hang on them the cards with our questions.  We started building it in 2D in order to make it more easy and readable but only after having spent some hours of 'pointless' weaving did we realise this does not work well.

- not everything has to make sense   
I have always been spending much time thinking what - why - where - how before I started getting my hands dirty. Partly because in my previous institution there had to be a very strong and concrete answer to all thy *whys* one could possibly ask about a project. *why this and not that, why now and not then, why here and not there* and so on. The problem is that when trying to respond to all of this, the creativity process can be blocked, cut off in its roots. That is why I always find it extremely hard to begin my practice. especially when I have a white, empty canvas looking at me, waiting for my creations to fill in. Thankfully, collaborating with other people can help significantly to kick-off without over procrastinating and overthinking.
