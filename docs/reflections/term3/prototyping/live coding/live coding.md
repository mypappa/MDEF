One particularly practical exercise I engaged in was live coding with Citlali. It was an exciting and entirely new experience for me, opening my eyes to the vast possibilities within the realm of technology.
During the live coding exercise we used 'Hydra', a visually oriented programming language designed for real-time collaboration and experimentation. Witnessing the results of our coding efforts materialize on the screen in real-time was impressive and very engaging. The vibrant colors and captivating shapes added an extra layer of allure to the experience, enhancing both the act of coding and the accompanying music.  

Citlali and Xavi, our guides through this journey inspired up with their enthusiasm and their passion for the subject, motivating me to continue learning about the possibilities that these tools and frameworks have to offer.  

As I reflect on the live coding experience with Citlali, I am reminded that technology is an ever-expanding universe waiting to be explored. The exercise served as a reminder that with dedication, curiosity, and the right tools, we can create something really cool.

at the end of the class we were introduced to the concept of 'algorave': a concept that started in 2011 in London and is essentially a 'rave' type event where the music is generated from algorithms, often using live coding techniques. Coincidentally there was an algorave party in Poblenou the day after the class where Citlali was going to take part as well so we booked tickets right away and went.  

it was a very interesting experience, different than the usual electronic music parties that I have been. it had more of a 'nerdy' vibe, perhaps because of the people who were not there by chance..!
