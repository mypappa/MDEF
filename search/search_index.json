In the same way, if we could come closer to the idea of \u2018losing\u2019 nature and see it as a \u2019moral\u2019 temporary phase which at some point be transformed to something else, we might then be able to have a different, liberated relationship with our surroundings.\u201d What do you think on the above idea? I also believe that having a relationship with death, and being conscious of our own mortality, changes our relationship to life and how we show up in the present moment. Memento Mori, the Latin phrase meaning \u201cwe must die\u201d indicates that historically and also across cultures, this knowing has held much significance. In what ways can we individually but also collectively change our approach towards death? Do you think it can be implemented in educational frameworks? I think learning about death in multiple capacities can and should be implemented in educational frameworks. Late industrial capitalism has largely eroded the norm of multigenerational families, where babies and children, young adults, and elders all exist together. In a multigenerational family or community structure, young people are exposed to and included in the cycle of life as part of the daily order. This is how people have been educated about death for millenia: by witnessing it, and learning and participating in the rituals that honour it. Recent developments of senior assisted living facilities and nursing homes have taken elders out of domestic life and placed them into institutionalized, medicalized care, and largely out of sight of younger generations. Similarly, the rise of funeral homes have institutionalized\u2013and capitalized\u2013on death, and taken a domestic event (vigil, wake, memorial) out of the home. One way to educate people about death is through generational knowledge and tradition, and, if not multigenerational families, then multigenerational relationships more broadly. These could be familial, community, or educational relationships. However, many of those communication bridges have been broken, in part due to the systems our society has created to contain elders and death. I think it is part of our work\u2013individual and collective both\u2013to re-establish intergenerational connections. Beyond this, educating about death in an institutionalized way, like through the public education system for instance, would be a valuable addition to school curriculum\u2013age appropriate of course (although determining this, or agreeing on it, could be a difficult task!). This could include practical information about estates, taxes, and laws (Math and/or Social Studies curriculum), and the physical process & stages of death (Health curriculum), as well as mindfulness and meditation practices (not sure where schools are putting these into the curricula now but they are entering, which is a great start), and cultural traditions (Social Studies/History). This change, as all changes, needs to be implemented both individually and collectively, simultaneously, over time. Can near-death experiences become inspiration besides trauma? How can we open new pathways of knowledge and understanding, and have intentional out-of-body experiences in alternative / legal ways? Gabor Mat\u00e9 is well known for saying that \u201cTrauma is not what happens to you, but what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.\u201d Near death experiences may only be traumatic if there are not adequate resources to process and integrate the experience. These resources could be practical, emotional, relational, and more. Because there is so much collective fear around death, and focus on living at all costs, folks who have a near death experience may not get the emotional and relational support that they need to understand what happened to them from a perspective that isn\u2019t fearful. There are some archives of accounts by people who have had near death and out of body experiences. I\u2019m thinking particularly of the first episode in the Netflix docuseries \u201cSurviving Death\u201d, which interviews some people about their experiences, but there are many others, especially in book form. The other episodes in the series each focus on different aspects of the life-death continuum and are all worth watching. What I appreciate about the series is its seeming intention to dispel fear around death and dying, rather than to perpetuate it. For those of us who haven\u2019t had a near death experience, or for those of us who haven\u2019t died yet (the latter of which is all of us\u2013ha), how we view and understand the event might have much to do with how we are first introduced to the idea. Part of the importance of educating about death, especially from early childhood, is around dispelling fears around it. Meditators have been having intentional in-body and out-of-body experiences for millenia. As you likely know, there are numerous texts, hailing from many traditions, written about the methods for achieving these states, probably accessible in our preferred reading language. There\u2019s a lot there to unpack around issues of privilege and appropriation. That said, I think that having a meditation practice\u2013learning how to manipulate consciousness through focused awareness\u2013is a universally important preparation for death. When practicing the coaching, do you prepare people by getting them through the stages of dying? Like \u2019simulating\u2019 it somehow? What is the goal and what is the profile of the people who usually approach you? With the clients who work with me in my capacity as an end of life doula, yes, I educate about the stages of the dying process. I don\u2019t simulate this with them; rather, I communicate the stages in simple, succinct language, sometimes more than once (one of the ways we learn is by repetition). I also facilitate yoga nidra (yogic sleep) meditations for my clients. The practice of yoga nidra contains several consciousness exercises. I don\u2019t view any of these exercises as a simulation of death either, but I do see them as preparations. The people who work with me have diverse, and often multiple goals, which include but are not limited to: starting or completing practical affairs and the creation of end of life / death documents (medical and financial power of attorney, advance healthcare directive, will); navigating decisions for physical care at the end of life or plans for after death; resolving emotional baggage; setting personal or professional goals for the remaining time alive; making legacy gifts; developing a spiritual practice or awareness; and the act of dying itself, to which I come as a witness. In some yoga practices they believe that if one can attain deep lucidity in dreams and in life, when death comes they will be prepared. What u think of that? Is death a conscious disembodied experience? I don\u2019t feel I can speak to the piece on lucidity in dreams preparing someone for death, but as I have said, I do believe that meditation practices are important preparations for death. I think that if meditation can become a normal and regular state for people to achieve in life, it will be accessible to us in the moments of our approaching death. More than that, I think we can\u2019t expect to achieve a meditative state at the moment of death if we don\u2019t know what that feels like and how to enter it. Recently I heard a theory (I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t recall the source) that we experience death based on what we believe about it\u2013that literally the vision of death that we have in our minds becomes the reality we each experience. This suggests that ultimately everyone\u2019s experience of death will be unique. This seems plausible to me, based both on the immense diversity of all other recorded human experiences, no matter how universal the event, and on the image-making machinery of the brain and eyes\u2013eyes capture light only, and all images are produced in the brain and projected outward. If I follow this theory, I realize that I should really make some conscious choices about what I believe about death, which necessarily involves interrogating everything that I have learned about it from the dominant culture. I think that death can be a conscious experience, but we must practice for it. And when death is a conscious experience, when consciousness is aware of itself, the experience of death, I expect, would not be a disembodied experience, but rather a disembodying experience, in which consciousness maintains itself and awareness of itself before, during, and after it exits the body. The premise for this is embodiment, in which the body is acknowledged as an intelligent container of consciousness.","title":"exploring"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#ecstatic-dance-participation","text":"\u201cEcstatic dance is a form of dance in which the dancers, without the need to follow specific steps, abandon themselves to the rhythm and move freely as the music takes them, leading to trance and a feeling of ecstasy.\u201d","title":"ecstatic dance    participation"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#time-zero-challenge","text":"visit the \u201cliving with your own ideas\u201d section or simply click on the title for more details","title":"time-zero   challenge"},{"location":"process/exploring/exploring/#hermetic-spirituality-lecture","text":"Hermetic Spirituality and Altered states of Knowledge by Prof. dr.

I always used storytelling as a medium to develop a new project that addresses the mega-phenomena around us. Coming from a semi-technical school, I also discovered the power of technology and its fascinating physical and digital outcomes. THESIS The milestone of my past academic experience is my thesis project called \u201cPlastic Age\u201d which was developed with my colleague Maria. The project triggers the ecological crisis we are experiencing and the ways humans are trying to control it. In essence, the project is a alternative narrative about the plastic accumulation on the planet, that questions and redefines the notion of nature. By seeing plastic as a \u201chyperobject\u201d, we created a plastic city, built by its own waste products. A new layer of plastic covered the ancient city and gradually started spreading around the world. In this entirely artificial era, nature as we know it is nothing but an ancestral monument. By playfully flirting between dystopic and utopic approach, we tried to discover new qualities within this supposedly tragic scenario. Coming to today, while configuring my current fight and its multiple dimensions, I came across to the concept of filter bubbles.

I always used storytelling as a medium to develop a new project that addresses the mega-phenomena around us. Coming from a semi-technical school, I also discovered the power of technology and its fascinating physical and digital outcomes. THESIS The milestone of my past academic experience is my thesis project called \u201cPlastic Age\u201d which was developed with my colleague Maria. The project triggers the ecological crisis we are experiencing and the ways humans are trying to control it. In essence, the project is a alternative narrative about the plastic accumulation on the planet, that questions and redefines the notion of nature. By seeing plastic as a \u201chyperobject\u201d, we created a plastic city, built by its own waste products. A new layer of plastic covered the ancient city and gradually started spreading around the world. In this entirely artificial era, nature as we know it is nothing but an ancestral monument. By playfully flirting between dystopic and utopic approach, we tried to discover new qualities within this supposedly tragic scenario. Coming to today, while configuring my current fight and its multiple dimensions, I came across to the concept of filter bubbles.

Gould, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, had read a 2014 study that found the presence of men, but not women, dulls mice\u2019s pain, and according to a university news release, his team also heard anecdotes from other labs about experimental results that seemed to be influenced by researcher sex. So they decided to test whether this could explain the inconsistencies they saw, since they couldn\u2019t replicate their experiments. The team reported in an August 30 Nature Neuroscience paper that the sex of researchers working with mice did indeed influence outcomes involving ketamine treatment, with the scent of human males triggering the release of a hormone in mice\u2019s brains that enabled the drug to work as an antidepressant. The findings suggest that researcher sex may confound animal research in a variety of experiments . \u201cOur findings in mice suggests that activating a specific stress circuit in the brain may be a way to improve ketamine treatment\u201d Gould says in the university announcement. The researchers also delved into the mechanisms behind that effect, and found that when men administered ketamine to the mice, a hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was released in an area of the mouse hippocampus associated with depression, enabling the ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effect. This didn\u2019t happen when women administered the drug unless they accompanied the ketamine with a dose of CRF. Gerlinde Metz of the University of Lethbridge in Canada tells New Scientist that researcher sex is just one of many variables that can affect animal experiments; others include their shipment to the lab, diet, and even the season. She says researchers should try to control for the effects of these variables as best they can, although it may be impossible to do so completely.\u201d https://www.newscientist.com/article/2337160-the-sex-of-the-researcher-can-influence-results-of-mouse-experiments/ https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/sex-of-researcher-influences-ketamine-s-effects-in-mice-study-70468 article reflection \u00b6 When I read the title of this article, at first it caught my attention because of the statement. The human\u2019s gender role in mice experiments sounds definitely an unexpected and interesting observation, so as the possible benefits to the medicine\u2019s effect in humans. But this was not the reason I chose this article for the assignment. From the very first until the last day of the course Nuria was strongly stressing out the importance of keeping track of the experiment\u2019s conditions, like any slight modification we make in our recipes and keeping track of every single variable that can possibly affect the results. Truth is, it has been almost impossible for us not to make any mistake or improvising a little. But at least in our case we could still be aware of it.

The wearable mask will be tied around and covering my face. It consists of a base made out of plastic bottle covered in a layer of aluminium foil which will be transforming. It works as an extension of the face, like a piece of clothing. It can adapt its surface depending on the situation. What does it notice? It notices my personal needs when interacting with people and transforms the material, the face expressions or any kind of message I want to communicate to the surroundings through its outer layer. What were you thinking? My wishful superpower has always been the ability to disappear and become temporarily invisible. To some extent it is related to my need for control over my appearance, my body, myself. The face is like a screen which projects personal information even in unwanted situations. At the same time, the pure characteristics of the face regardless of the expression can cause prejudiced and biased reactions. My aim was to somehow protect - address - test the above situations on a personal and on a social level. Why does it matter? The \u2018mask\u2019 is a very primitive yet contemporary object with a great history in multiple fields: It can be used an object for performing arts, rituals, punishment, disguise, fashion, hygiene etc. This particular idea of mask attempts to become an integral part of the self in daily life which will open new communication channels with the environment and bring comfort in uncomfortable situations. Companion reflection \u00b6 After wearing the mask and moving around the city for a day, I noticed the following contradictions : - comfort in hiding vs discomfort in breathing - liberating expression vs limiting communication - sense of protection vs opportunity for exposure - attention avoidance (eg random unwanted acquaintances) vs attention catcher (it looks quite creepy) 24h challenge \u00b6 Exercise brief: - How can you take action on your topic in a brave way? - Can you make some small piece of your idea and live with it? - How can you probe the design space through an embodied / first-person exploration? - Can you create a situation that might reveal something new? time-zero \u00b6 According to the task timeframe, we were given one and a half day to complete the exercise, meaning to come up with an idea, start applying it, document it and present it in a 1-minute video. Everything had to be done very quickly, which for me and my personal rhythm was just unimaginable. The topics of my interest (for the moment) are quite abstract, vague and seemingly unrelated to each other. So in order to come up with a concept directly related to my topics and matching the assignment requirements, I needed at least one week. And then another week to plan the application of the idea, and then one more to prepare the video. Obviously this was not even close to possible. Therefore I started thinking in a \u2018reversed\u2019 way: \u2022 What if my biggest struggle on the assignment (and in life) becomes the idea I have been looking for? \u2022 What happens if I act instead of think? \u2022 What would my day look like if I have zero time to think? \u2022 How would I react to my stimuli without any sort of processing? \u2022 Is it possible to forcefully interrupt the thinking process (at least the conscious one) and how can I do it? The moment this idea came to my mind, I immediately started applying it. At the same time, my classmates started asking for help in their own projects. I gave myself 2-3 seconds to decide and reply, which led me to a very intense, uncontrolled and versatile day. I got dressed in 5 seconds to go for padel (I wore my pyjama top). Then I went to the beach where I helped in shooting some videos for other projects. When we finished the shooting I went to Elisava for a quick meeting with Oscar (couldn\u2019t have been long since it would interrupt my no-thinking process). On that moment I realised I hadn\u2019t thought of charging my phone, so my documentation capabilities were also limited. While unceasingly applying this challenge during my day, I also came up with 3 mini-challenges within the main one: \u2022 10-minute weekly groceries \u2022 20-minute nonstop writing \u2022 no recipe fast baking (zero cooking / baking knowledge) At the end of the day I was physically and mentally exhausted. TIME-ZERO challenge by Myrto-Eirini Pappa challenge reflection \u00b6 What did you make? And why did it matter? Taking time to think and process before acting has always been my comfort zone . What I did was an experiment to force myself out of it, to expose my instinctive, unprocessed thoughts and actions. Living in fast-pace and losing control over my life is a great fear and a risk I wouldn\u2019t have taken easily. What happens when you involve yourself? I always thought that my projects were somehow self-involving, because I have always been truthful to what I want to represent. Nevertheless, I realise that I have always been keeping a certain distance from involving my inner self with the fear of getting too self-inclusive. After having performed my first experiment with a deeper self-involvement I value the process differently: there are no longer strong distinctions between the \u2018work\u2019, the \u2018personal life\u2019, the \u2018hobbies\u2019, the \u2018free time\u2019 etc. Everything blends and overlaps with one another, creating a whole interconnected mass. And this feels way more human . What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? When the source of knowledge is your own body, the result is more powerful and long-lasting. It somehow changes a part of your being, and consequently your design practice. The outcome is an authentic, genuine , undeniable point of view which can not be predetermined. Nevertheless there are always two sides: I got passionate and excited but also more frustrated. I was not able to switch to another subject or just take a break since I was the designer and I was the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. Did anything change about your way of working? (still writing) The way \u0399 worked that day was the complete opposite of what I\u2019m used to. I tried to switch from being extremely slow and indecisive, to being extremely fast and direct. What I realised was that \u2018time\u2019 is a luxury which can either reinforce or prevent the project\u2019s development. Having plenty of time can be helpful in building confidence and deeper understanding on the work, but at the same time it might be confusing: Analysing every possibility leads to information overload and procrastination, which misguides and disconnects the project from the original penchant. From my experience, both \u2018extremes\u2019 come with their own set of implications. My goal is to find the right balance between the two and be able to switch modes according to my needs. What does it mean for your future work? After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? to be discovered..","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"track: Reflection","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#invisible-me","text":"Make a living / non-living companion How will you live together?

It notices my personal needs when interacting with people and transforms the material, the face expressions or any kind of message I want to communicate to the surroundings through its outer layer. What were you thinking? My wishful superpower has always been the ability to disappear and become temporarily invisible. To some extent it is related to my need for control over my appearance, my body, myself. The face is like a screen which projects personal information even in unwanted situations. At the same time, the pure characteristics of the face regardless of the expression can cause prejudiced and biased reactions. My aim was to somehow protect - address - test the above situations on a personal and on a social level. Why does it matter? The \u2018mask\u2019 is a very primitive yet contemporary object with a great history in multiple fields: It can be used an object for performing arts, rituals, punishment, disguise, fashion, hygiene etc. This particular idea of mask attempts to become an integral part of the self in daily life which will open new communication channels with the environment and bring comfort in uncomfortable situations.","title":"inVISIBLE me"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#companion-reflection","text":"After wearing the mask and moving around the city for a day, I noticed the following contradictions : - comfort in hiding vs discomfort in breathing - liberating expression vs limiting communication - sense of protection vs opportunity for exposure - attention avoidance (eg random unwanted acquaintances) vs attention catcher (it looks quite creepy)","title":"Companion reflection"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#24h-challenge","text":"Exercise brief: - How can you take action on your topic in a brave way? - Can you make some small piece of your idea and live with it? - How can you probe the design space through an embodied / first-person exploration? - Can you create a situation that might reveal something new?","title":"24h challenge"},{"location":"reflections/term1/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#time-zero","text":"According to the task timeframe, we were given one and a half day to complete the exercise, meaning to come up with an idea, start applying it, document it and present it in a 1-minute video. Everything had to be done very quickly, which for me and my personal rhythm was just unimaginable. The topics of my interest (for the moment) are quite abstract, vague and seemingly unrelated to each other. So in order to come up with a concept directly related to my topics and matching the assignment requirements, I needed at least one week. And then another week to plan the application of the idea, and then one more to prepare the video. Obviously this was not even close to possible. Therefore I started thinking in a \u2018reversed\u2019 way: \u2022 What if my biggest struggle on the assignment (and in life) becomes the idea I have been looking for? \u2022 What happens if I act instead of think? \u2022 What would my day look like if I have zero time to think? \u2022 How would I react to my stimuli without any sort of processing? \u2022 Is it possible to forcefully interrupt the thinking process (at least the conscious one) and how can I do it? The moment this idea came to my mind, I immediately started applying it. At the same time, my classmates started asking for help in their own projects. I gave myself 2-3 seconds to decide and reply, which led me to a very intense, uncontrolled and versatile day. I got dressed in 5 seconds to go for padel (I wore my pyjama top). Then I went to the beach where I helped in shooting some videos for other projects. When we finished the shooting I went to Elisava for a quick meeting with Oscar (couldn\u2019t have been long since it would interrupt my no-thinking process). On that moment I realised I hadn\u2019t thought of charging my phone, so my documentation capabilities were also limited. While unceasingly applying this challenge during my day, I also came up with 3 mini-challenges within the main one: \u2022 10-minute weekly groceries \u2022 20-minute nonstop writing \u2022 no recipe fast baking (zero cooking / baking knowledge) At the end of the day I was physically and mentally exhausted.

And why did it matter? Taking time to think and process before acting has always been my comfort zone . What I did was an experiment to force myself out of it, to expose my instinctive, unprocessed thoughts and actions. Living in fast-pace and losing control over my life is a great fear and a risk I wouldn\u2019t have taken easily. What happens when you involve yourself? I always thought that my projects were somehow self-involving, because I have always been truthful to what I want to represent. Nevertheless, I realise that I have always been keeping a certain distance from involving my inner self with the fear of getting too self-inclusive. After having performed my first experiment with a deeper self-involvement I value the process differently: there are no longer strong distinctions between the \u2018work\u2019, the \u2018personal life\u2019, the \u2018hobbies\u2019, the \u2018free time\u2019 etc. Everything blends and overlaps with one another, creating a whole interconnected mass. And this feels way more human . What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? When the source of knowledge is your own body, the result is more powerful and long-lasting. It somehow changes a part of your being, and consequently your design practice. The outcome is an authentic, genuine , undeniable point of view which can not be predetermined. Nevertheless there are always two sides: I got passionate and excited but also more frustrated. I was not able to switch to another subject or just take a break since I was the designer and I was the \u201cguinea pig\u201d. Did anything change about your way of working? (still writing) The way \u0399 worked that day was the complete opposite of what I\u2019m used to. I tried to switch from being extremely slow and indecisive, to being extremely fast and direct. What I realised was that \u2018time\u2019 is a luxury which can either reinforce or prevent the project\u2019s development. Having plenty of time can be helpful in building confidence and deeper understanding on the work, but at the same time it might be confusing: Analysing every possibility leads to information overload and procrastination, which misguides and disconnects the project from the original penchant. From my experience, both \u2018extremes\u2019 come with their own set of implications. My goal is to find the right balance between the two and be able to switch modes according to my needs.

As a person who hardly ever cooks, I really appreciate the ease of eating it raw (or cooked) and its relatively high nutrition value. Another fascinating part is its inner shapes.

It is essentially a leaf-overlay with various thicknesses on its body. empties - solids, hards - softs. As a human, I can read on it mathematic structures, tree diagrams, neural networks, or free handrawings. Another interesting aspect is that it changes its color according to the pH value of the soil due to a pigment belonging to anthocyanins. In acidic soils, the leaves grow more reddish; in neutral soils, they will grow more purple, while an alkaline soil will produce rather greenish-yellow colored cabbages.
