unfortunately, I was not able to attend most of this class in person so my personal reflection and experience about this week is mostly based on the documentation I could find on the drive, the personal research inspired by this documentation and the inputs from my classmates.  

I had roughly heard of 'distributed design' as a concept, but never had actually looked deeper into it.  

## the iceberg - mushroom model

The Iceberg Model is a tool that shows how the most obvious part of a system is supported by the hidden, non-obvious part. It represents how events around us are connected to patterns of behavior, systems structures, and mental models. The goal is to move from just seeing events to challenging the mental models that support the system. The concept of "emergence" explains how the obvious parts of a system are connected to complex elements that allow it to occur. For example, a mushroom is an emergent property of the complex hidden system of mycelium, which runs underground and connects all the trees and plants in the ecosystem. The mushroom is the obvious outcome, while the mycelium represents the complex mental models that connect all the underlying systems. The mycelium is the original recycler of nature and supports the decay of organic material to create building blocks for new life to emerge. The redesigned Iceberg Model shows how the interconnected relationships reinforce the systems around us, using the metaphor of the way the mushroom/mycelium system enables ecosystems to communicate and flourish.

together with Josephine and June, we worked on a mushroom model analysing the 'plastic bottle'. It seemed like a specific objective at first but it turned out to be much more complex than we thought..

## the reflection tree

After following the text on the miro and practicing my opown reflection accordingly, it turns out that my project does not fulfill all of the values. Nevertheless, reflecting on a project's impact can help identify areas for improvement and provide insights for creating more open, collaborative, regenerative, and ecosystemic projects. I realised that it's important to approach the Reflection Tree with an open and honest mindset and not worry about achieving perfect scores. Every project is unique, and its alignment with the platform's values depends on its specific goals and context. The goal is to use the Reflection Tree as a tool for growth and improvement rather than a test to pass.  

## learning skills  
*Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?*  

Distributed design would likely require strong collaboration skills, as it emphasizes working in a decentralized and inclusive manner. This means being able to effectively communicate, listen to others, and work towards common goals. These collaboration skills are essential for any team-based project and can be useful in a variety of contexts, including work, social, and personal life.

Additionally, the mushroom model, which emphasizes creating self-sustaining systems, requires a good understanding of the principles of regenerative design, including sustainable resource use and ecosystemic thinking. These skills can be translated into a more conscious approach to personal and professional decision-making, where environmental and social impacts are considered and minimized.

As for the reflection tree, it encourages critical thinking and self-evaluation, skills that are valuable in any field or situation. Being able to assess one's impact and identify areas for improvement can help with personal growth, goal-setting, and creating positive change in the world.  


## dynamics   
*How was the dynamic inside the group?*   

While I did not have the chance to experience the group dynamic directly, observing the potentialities of the group can still offer some valuable insights.  the group dynamic is likely to be highly collaborative and inclusive, emphasizing participation from all members. This type of dynamic is often facilitated through various techniques such as consensus-based decision-making, active listening, and open communication. The mushroom model, in particular, is a highly collaborative approach to design that involves many stakeholders, including designers, users, and producers. This requires a high degree of collaboration and communication to ensure that everyone's needs and perspectives are taken into account. The self-reflection can lead to a more constructive and collaborative group dynamic, where each member takes responsibility for their own contributions to the group's success.

## interactions   
*Did the role I played influence my opinion?*  

my role in the group could have influenced my perspective and opinion of the group dynamic, as different roles can provide varying perspectives and experiences. For example, if I had taken on a leadership role in the group, it may have a different opinion of the dynamic compared to someone who takes on a more passive role. My absence from the class may have limited my exposure to the group dynamic and consequently influenced my opinion in a different way than if I had been present.
