### _know thy non-human neighbors  
We visited the bes√≤s river, a river flowing through Barcelona formed by the confluence of the Mogent and Congost rivers. It ends in the Mediterranean.  
We spent some time exploring the site and the surroundings in order to understand the dynamics and sense the balances and imbalances. We focused on the non-human critters and their interactivity, but we mainly found remains of their passage.
